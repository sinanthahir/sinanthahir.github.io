Objective The goal of this project is to provide analysis on SpaceX launches, with focus on stage reuse and landings, to provide our company, SpaceY, competitive information on cost of launches and prediction methods on whether SpaceX will reuse a given stage.\nMethodology  Data collection:  SpaceX API: Past landing data, plus info on boosters, cores, payloads; Wikipedia scrape: Parse tables of past launches (including outcomes ‚Äî success/failure) into a DataFrame for next stage.   Data wrangling:  Outcomes (‚ÄúTrue ASDS‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrue Ocean‚Äù, etc.) grouped into two classes ‚Äî success (1) and failure (0); Column ‚Äòclass‚Äô added to DataFrame, to be used for model building and prediction.   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Visualization and SQL:  Data loaded into IBM Cloud DB2 instance; SQL queries run from Jupyter notebook; Plotly and Seaborn; categorical plots (scatter, bar, line); One-hot encoding of features.   Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash:  Folium maps + marker clusters: show launch sites; Dashboard: show successes for all launch sites, success percentage per site, and payload per launch.   Predictive analysis using classification models:  Split data between training and testing; Train and test 4 models: LogReg (logistic regression), SVM (support vector machine), Tree (decision tree), KNN (K nearest neighbors); Grid Search with a set of hyperparams; check model scores (R^2); build confusion matrix for each; ‚Äî\u0026gt; select best model.    Conclusions (Predictive Model)  Out of 4 prediction models (LogReg, SVM, Tree, KNN), SVM had the best accuracy on training data, and among the best at scores on test data. The Tree model appeared the weakest. Test vs Training data accuracy are not the same.

Professor, Rajadhani Institute of Engineering and Technology, Attingal\r\rObjective Compact heat exchangers have become an essential necessity for power production and multi other purposes on a daily basis. The corrugated plate exchangers (CPHE) are well known for their high thermal performance. This study compares two CPHE with angle 70/70 (deg) and 50/50 (deg) with basic CPHE with angle 60/60.\n It was our first time, engage in such a complex design and simulation featured model or to say for an research orientation. Each and every day, we will go for a new design from scratch and simulate in varying conditions; and above all that the numerical model expressions. Every night we will be on g-meet, discussing reference journals, user manuals to binge cringes. It was hard but fun.\n  Amidst on the pandemic, Ramzy Rahim, Akhil A, Devakrishna A and I under the guidance of Asst. Prof Benny TK was researching on the thermal performance character inside the CPHE for turbulent flow conditions as for our Final year Bachelors Degree Project. The work was assessed in the presence of Dr.Bindu S, HOD, Asst. professor, Mr. Harishanker U.S, Asst. Professor, Project coordinator and other faculties of our department.\n Methodology The different CPHE models are designed using Solidworks 2020, Flow and Thermal Analysis was done through Ansys Workbench (Fluent), Analytical Calculation are carried out on MS Excel, Infographics are made up on Mathlab and Work scheduling are done using Notion.\nResults The overall tests have been conducted on CPHEs for two symmetric chevron angles (Œ≤) of 50/50 and 70/70. Data are obtained for steady state, single phase (water-water), counter arrangements, and for Reynolds number (Re) ranges from 500 to 2500, sophisticated mesh technique have been adopted to develop the mesh for the plates and the fluid between the plates. An appropriate grid refinement test has been carried out for the accuracy of the numerical results. The result have been validated with benchmark experimental and numerical data. A realizable k ‚Äì Œµ turbulence model with scalable wall treatment found to provide the most consistent and accurate prediction of the thermal performance of CPHE. The numerical result showed that the effectiveness of the CPHE 50/50 is higher than 60/60 but the CPHE 70/70 shows less effectiveness than other.\nPublication The result came to a much dependable solution on each variance of flow parameters and are explained in the Journal(Paper) Published on IRJET Journal Volume: 8 Issue: 7.\n","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/showcase/ticphe/","title":"Thermal Performance Investigation"},{"content":"Industrial Product Design Mostly these are free time activity, turn out to be a full fledge concepts.\n Drone Design : SiniGator-X Sinigator-X is a Quadcopter Design submitted for the TechFest 2018 conducted by IIT Bombay.

After the system has learnt (we say that the system has been trained), we can use it to make predictions for new data, unseen before. This approach makes it possible to solve complex problems which are difficult or impossible to solve with traditional sequential programming.\nRecognizing handwritten text is a problem that traces back to the first automatic machines that needed to recognize individual characters in handwritten documents. Think about, for example, the ZIP codes on letters at the post office and the automation needed to recognize these five digits. Perfect recognition of these codes is necessary to sort mail automatically and efficiently. Included among the other applications that may come to mind is OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software. OCR software must read handwritten text, or pages of printed books, for general electronic documents in which each character is well defined. But the problem of handwriting recognition goes farther back in time, more precisely to the early 20th Century (the 1920s), when Emanuel Goldberg (1881‚Äì1970) began his studies regarding this issue and suggested that a statistical approach would be an optimal choice.\nIn this project, our goal is to get started hands on with machine learning to recognize this handwrittens, so I‚Äôm only going to give you a simplified explanation for now.\r\rThe above network displays a network of successive training sets, which consists of the image of a digit \u0026amp; a label, which tells us what the image truly represents.\nAt first, the first image is processed by the neural network and produces an answer: that is a 9. The connections of neurons in the network be in randomly stated and is providing anything useful, just a random answer.\nThe answer is compared to the label. Here, the value of (9) is actually different from the label, i.e the value (3). Some feedback is given back such that the network can improve, favoring in tend to give a correct answer.\nThen the next example are considered and the neural network learns in such iterative way.\nAim: The primary aim of this project involves predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font.\nHypothesis: The Digits data set of the scikit-learn library provides numerous datasets that are useful for testing many problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Some Scientist claims that it predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times. Perform data Analysis to accept or reject this Hypothesis.\n Here, I will be using Anaconda Kernel Interpreted VS Code Environment and using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.\n The Digits Dataset: The scikit-learn library provides many datasets that are useful for testing many problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Also in this case there is a dataset of images called Digits. This dataset comprises 1,797 images that are 8x8 pixels in size. Each image is a handwritten digit in grayscale.\nImporting Dataset Import datasets module from sklearn library and load the digits dataset using the load_digits() function.\nfrom sklearn import datasets\rdigits = datasets.load_digits()\rDescription of Dataset After loading the dataset, we can read the information about the dataset by calling the DESCR attribute.\nprint(digits.DESCR)\rThe textual description of the dataset, the authors who contributed to its creation, and the references will appear as shown in the output.\nEach dataset in the scikit-learn library has a field containing all the information.\nTargets The numerical values represented by images, i.e., the targets, are contained in the digit.targets array.\ndigits.target\rOutput:\rarray([0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, 8])\rDataset Shape Dimensions of the dataset can be obtained using data.shape() function.\ndigits.data.shape\rOutput:\r(1797, 64)\rThe output shows that the dataset has 1797 images of 8x8 size(i.e, 8 * 8 = 64 px). In other words, this array could be represented in 3D as a pile of images with 8x8 pixels each.\nImages of the handwritten digits The images of the handwritten digits are contained in an array. Each element of this array is an image that is represented by an 8x8 matrix of numerical values that correspond to grayscale from white, with a value of 0, to black, with the value 15.\nLet‚Äôs look at the data of the first 8x8 image. Each slot in the array corresponds to a pixel, and the value in the slot is the amount of black in the pixel.\ndigits.images[0]\rVisualization of an array We can visually check the contents of this result. The following steps can get it done\n Import pyplot module which is under matplotlib as plt. The imshow() function is used to display data as an image; i.e. on a 2D regular raster. cmap = gray_r displays a grayscale image. interpolation= ‚Äònearest‚Äô displays an image without trying to interpolate between pixels if the display resolution is not the same as the image resolution. The title() function is used to display the title on the graph.  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\rplt.imshow(digits.images[0], cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation='nearest')\rplt.title('one of the 1797 handwritten digits')\rplt.savefig('plot1.png', dpi=100, bbox_inches='tight')\rBy running this command, we will obtain the grayscale image as follows: Visualization of 10 digits Using the NumPy and matplotlib libraries, we can display each digit from 0 to 9 which are in the form of an array as images.\n The figure() function in the pyplot module of the matplotlib library is used to create a new figure with a specified size of (15,4). subplots_adjust(hspace=0.8) is used to adjust the space between the rows of the subplots. Combine two lists using the zip() function for easier handling inside the plotting loop. enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it. The returned object is a enumerate object. subplot() function is used to add a subplot to a current figure at the specified grid position.  import numpy as np plt.figure(figsize=(15,4))\rplt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.8)images_and_labels = list(zip(digits.images, digits.target)) for index, (image, label) in enumerate(images_and_labels[:10]): plt.subplot(2, 5, index + 1) plt.imshow(image, cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation='nearest') plt.title('Training: %i' % label, fontsize =12)\rplt.savefig('plot2.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')\rFlatten the input images The inputs are 8x8 grayscale images. we can produce a flat array of 64-pixel values so that each pixel corresponds to a column for the classifier.\n len() function gives the number of images in the dataset. reshape() function returns an array containing the same data with a new shape.  n = len(digits.images)\rprint(n)\rdata = digits.images.reshape((n, -1))\rOutput:\r1797\rIt was reported that the dataset is a training set consisting of 1,797 images. We determined that it is true.\nThe Machine Learning Model An estimator that is useful in this case is sklearn.svm.SVC, which uses the technique of Support Vector Classification (SVC).\n‚ÄúSupport Vector Machine‚Äù (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is mostly used in classification problems.\n You can read more about SVM model from Scikit-Learn‚Äôs Official Document.\n Import the SVM module of the scikit-learn library and create an estimator of SVC type and then choose an initial setting, assigning the values C and gamma generic values.\n#import svm model\rfrom sklearn import svm\r#Create a SVMClassifier\rsvc = svm.SVC(gamma=0.001, C=100.)\rSplit the Dataset once we define a predictive model, we must instruct it with a training and test set. The training set is a set of data in which you already know the belonging class and the test set is a secondary data set that is used to test a machine learning program after it has been trained on initial training.\nImport train_test_split() function which is used for splitting data arrays into two subsets i.e., into train and test sets.\nHere we have split the data by assigning 0.01 as test size.\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\rx_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, digits.target, test_size=0.01, random_state=0)\rTrain the model we can train the svc estimator that we defined earlier using the fit() function.\nAfter a short time, the trained estimator will appear with text output.\nsvc.fit(x_train, y_train)\rOutput:\rSVC(C=100.0, gamma=0.001)\rTest the model we can test our estimator by making it interpret the digits of the test set using predict() function.\ny_pred = svc.predict(x_test)\ry_pred\rOutput:\rarray([2, 8, 2, 6, 6, 7, 1, 9, 8, 5, 2, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0])\rWe obtain the results in the form of an array.\nVisualize the test images We can plot the images of the predicted digits from the array using the following code.\nimages_and_predictions = list(zip(x_test,y_pred))\rplt.figure(figsize=(18,5))\rfor index, (image, prediction) in enumerate(images_and_predictions[:19]):\rplt.subplot(2, 9, index + 1)\rimage = image.reshape(8, 8)\rplt.imshow(image, cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation='nearest')\rplt.title('Prediction: %i' % prediction)\r# save the figure\rplt.savefig('plot3.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')\rIt is able to recognize the handwritten digits and interprete all the digits of the validation set correctly.\nAccuracy of the model The accuracy score of the model can be obtained using the score() function.\nscore = svm.score(x_test, y_test)\rOutput:\rAccuracy Score: 1.0\rConfusion Matrix A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or ‚Äúclassifier‚Äù) on a set of test data for which the true values are known.\n#For Confusion Matrix\rfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\rimport pandas as pd\rimport seaborn as sn data = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\rdf_cm = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=np.unique(y_test), index = np.unique(y_test))\rdf_cm.index.name = 'Actual'\rdf_cm.columns.name = 'Predicted' plt.figure(figsize = (10,10))\rsn.set(font_scale=1.4)#for label size\rplt.title('Confusion Matrix')\rsn.heatmap(df_cm, annot=True,annot_kws={\u0026quot;size\u0026quot;: 12})# font size\rA Classification report is used to measure the quality of predictions from a classification algorithm.\nConclusion Given the large number of elements contained in the Digits dataset, we will certainly obtain a very effective model, i.e., one that‚Äôs capable of recognizing with good certainty.\nWe test the hypothesis by using these cases, each case for a different range of training and validation sets.\nAfter performing the data analysis on the dataset with three different test cases, we can conclude that the given hypothesis is true i.e., the model predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times.\n You can find Source code: github@sinanthahir\n ","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/blogs/recognizing-handwritten-digits/","title":"Machine Learning for Recognizing Handwritten Digits"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/tags/ml/","title":"ML"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/tags/scikit-learn/","title":"Scikit Learn"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/tags/eda/","title":"EDA"},{"content":"Experience Analysis through Weather Data : Exploratory Data Analysis Knowing accurate weather conditions is an important element for individuals as well as organizations. Many businesses rely on weather conditions. It is necessary to have the correct data to get accurate decisions. One type of data that‚Äôs easier to find on the internet is Weather data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters.\nExploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyze data, to summarize the main characteristics of data, and better understand the data set. It also allows us to quickly interpret the data and adjust different variables to see their effect. The three main steps to get a perfect EDA are extracting the data from an authorized source, cleaning and processing the data, and performing data visualization on the cleaned data set.\nHere, I will work through out a practical exploratory data analysis which was done a part of my data analytics internship at Suven Consultants \u0026amp; Technology.\nObjective: The main focus of our project was to perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming and finally put forth a conclusion.\nHypothesis: A hypothesis is an assumption, an idea that is proposed for the sake of argument so that it can be tested to see if it might be true. The Null Hypothesis H0 is ‚ÄúHas the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming‚Äù\r\rThat means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month says April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.\n So, What is this Apparent Temperature and Humidity mentioned in the Null Hypothesis (H0)?\n These are called Terminologies, or rather say the column names or criteria used to constrain the data we have to different specification or class. In order to know that we must look up for basic terminologies used in the data we are working on.\nTerminologies: Meteorological Data refers to data consisting of physical parameters that are measured directly by instrumentation, and include temperature, dew point, wind direction, wind speed, cloud cover, cloud layer(s), ceiling height, visibility, current weather, and precipitation amount.\nApparent temperature is the temperature equivalent perceived by humans, caused by the combined effects of air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The measure is most commonly applied to the perceived outdoor temperature.\nHumidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. If there is a lot of water vapor in the air, the humidity will be high. The higher the humidity, the wetter it feels outside.\n You can check out more weather terminologies from Kestrelmeter‚Äôs Glossary.\n Dataset: The dataset currently using, can be obtained from Kaggle. The dataset has hourly temperature recorded for the last 10 years starting from 2006‚Äì04‚Äì01 00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016‚Äì09‚Äì09 23:00:00.000 +0200. It corresponds to Finland, a country in Northern Europe.\n Now, we have our Objective, Dataset, and basic understanding of the Terminologies. So let‚Äôs start of journey to analyze the data!\n Data Preprocessing Here, i‚Äôm using Anaconda Environment with Visual Studio Code. You can also set up such a system which enable a faster git and pipeline integration.\nImporting required libraries: We will be using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.\nimport numpy as np\rimport pandas as pd\rimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\rimport seaborn as sns\rLoading dataset: Load the dataset using read_csv() function as the dataset is in CSV form and read the first 5 rows from data using head() function.\ndata = pd.read_csv('weatherHistory.csv')\rdata.head()\rDimensions of the dataframe refers to the overall data sample, i.e, the total number of rows and columns in the data. It can be obtained using data.shape function as follows\ndata.shape\rThe total number of rows and columns in the data set is 96453 and 12 respectively.\nTo find out the types and overall summary of the data frame, we use the data.info() function. It comes in handy when doing exploratory analysis of the data.\ndata.info()\rWe can use the describe() function to get the descriptive statistical details of the data-frame.\ndata.describe()\rTo check the distinct elements in the data frame, we can use the nunique() function.\ndata.nunique()\rWe can check for any missing values using the isnull() function. since having a large dataset, we can incorporate sum() function to get the total number of missing value in each columns.\ndata.isnull().sum()\rTill now, we had got up many details about the dataset we are working on. Lets take it into account.\nObservations:  In ‚ÄòPrecip Type‚Äô, there are 517 missing values. ‚ÄòWind Bearing (degrees)‚Äô has only integer values. Formatted Date is in String. Minimum values of Humidity, Wind Speed (km/h), Wind Bearing (degrees), Visibility (km) are Zero and they can be Zero. From Statistical details and Distinct Elements in Dataframe, It is noticed that ‚ÄôLoud Cover‚Äô are zero or null.  We can remove the unwanted columns which don‚Äôt add value to the analysis using the drop() function. We will drop ‚ÄòLoud Cover‚Äô as it has one unique value 0 and it is not useful in analysis.\ndata = data.drop([‚ÄòLoud Cover‚Äô], axis = 1)\rCorrelation of the Columns: Correlation matrices are an essential tool of exploratory data analysis. We can display the pairwise correlation using corr() function which creates the correlation matrix between all the features in the dataset. Correlation heatmaps contain the same information in a visually appealing way.\n# assign data correlation matrix\rrelation = data.corr()\r# Increase the size of the heatmap\rplt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\r# Store heatmap object in a variable to easily access it\rwhen you want to include more features and you can set the annotation parameter to True to display the correlation values on the heatmap.\rsns.heatmap(data=relation)\r# Give a title to the heatmap.\rplt.title(\u0026quot;Correlation of columns in the dataframe\u0026quot;)\r# save the figure.\rplt.savefig('plot1.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')\rplt.show()\rObservation: From the Pairwise correlation chart, we can see that Apparent Temperature and Humidity have a high degree of correlation with each other. So we have a high chance of validating our hypothesis.\nWe only need 3 columns for checking and validating our task which is data [‚ÄòFormatted Date‚Äô, ‚ÄòApparent Temperature(c)‚Äô, ‚ÄòHumidity‚Äô]. So, we can ignore other columns and missing values.\nParsing Dates, Creating new dataframe : Change the ‚ÄòFormatted Date‚Äô feature from String to Datetime using the datetime() function.\ndata[‚ÄòFormatted Date‚Äô] = pd.to_datetime(data[‚ÄòFormatted Date‚Äô],utc=True)\rWe can set ‚ÄúFormatted Date‚Äù as an index using the set_index() function which sets the DataFrame index (row labels) using one or more existing columns.\ndata = data.set_index(‚ÄúFormatted Date‚Äù)\rdata.info()\rResampling Data: Resampling is a convenient method for frequency conversion. The object must have a datetime like an index.\nNow, we have hourly data, we need to resample it to monthly. We only require the Apparent Temperature and humidity columns to test the hypothesis. So, we will consider these two columns and perform a resample() function from Pandas.\ndf_column = ['Apparent Temperature (C)', 'Humidity']\rdf_monthly_mean = data[df_column].resample(\u0026quot;MS\u0026quot;).mean() #MS-Month Starting\rdf_monthly_mean.head()\rNow, we converts hourly data to monthly data using ‚ÄúMS‚Äù which denotes the Month starting. We are displaying the average apparent temperature and humidity using the mean() function.\n We are done with cleaning and resampling it. Now, Lets begin our analysis.\n Relation between Apparent Temperature \u0026amp; Humidity Using Regression: We can use the regplot() function to plot the relationship between the ‚ÄúApparent Temperature ‚Äù and ‚ÄúHumidity‚Äù.\n# calling regplot function and assign it with our data and plot labels and color parameter.\rsns.regplot(data=df_monthly_mean, x=\u0026quot;Apparent Temperature (C)\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;Humidity\u0026quot;, color=\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;)\r# Give a title to the plot\rplt.title(\u0026quot;Relation between Apparent Temperature (C) and Humidity\u0026quot;)\r# save the figure\rplt.savefig('plot2.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')\rplt.show()\rObservation: There is a Linear Relation between ‚ÄúApparent Temperature ‚Äù and ‚ÄúHumidity‚Äù with a negative slope.\nAs air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, and its relative humidity decreases.

There is a sharp rise of temperature between year 2008‚Äì2009 which again decreases in year 2009‚Äì2010. It is observed that the average Apparent Temperature is at its peak in year 2009 which further drops to its lowest in year 2015. Whereas the average Humidity has remained nearly constant over the period of time.  Conclusion: From this analysis, We can conclude that the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming. This clears that our Null Hypothesis is having a True positive impact.\nMiscellaneous: You can do more analysis on the data, the more we question the data, the better we know about it.

The name MATLAB stands for matrix laboratory. MATLAB was originally written to provide easy access to matrix software developed by the LINPACK and EISPACK projects, which together represent the state-of-the-art in software for matrix computation.\nMATLAB is an interactive system whose basic data element is an array that does not require dimensioning. This allows you to solve many technical computing problems, especially those with matrix and vector formulations, in a fraction of the time it would take to write a program in a scalar noninteractive language such as C or Fortran.\nMATLAB¬Æ is widely used in different areas of applied mathematics, in education and research and in numerous industries. This software finds its wide applications in different domains of engineering such as:\n Electronics engineers mainly use MATLAB¬Æ for designing more efficient devices that are smaller in size and can integrate wireless communications, audio, video, and other attributes. In electrical engineering, the application of this program is to examine and simulate momentary phenomena in power systems. Mechanical engineers need MATLAB¬Æ for scrutiny of problems in control systems, mechanical vibrations, basic engineering mechanics, electrical circuits, statics and dynamics and numerical methods. It is used to model and simulate physical problems in the field of chemical engineering.

Though it was invented in 1980s it has popularized recently and has been applied to various field, ranging from biomedical science to space science.\n4D printing is a recently developed field originating from 3D printing, shows promising capabilities and broad potential applications. 4D printing was initiated and termed by research group at MIT lead by \u0026lsquo;Tibbits\u0026rsquo;(2013). It relies on the fast growth of smart materials, 3D printers, and mathematical modeling and design. 4D printing shows advantages over 3D printing in several aspects. Its application is beyond we can ever think. Its now in its embryonic stage as 3D printing it will take few decades to come into its full potential. Multi-disciplinary researches will aid in its growth.\n4D PRINTING It was initially defined as 4D printing = 3D printing + time, where the shape, property, or functionality of a 3D printed structure can change as a function of time. A much more comprehensive definition is, 4D printing is a targeted evolution of the 3D printed structure, in terms of shape, property, and functionality. It is capable of achieving self-assembly, multifunctionality, and self-repair. It is time-dependent, printer-independent, and predictable.\n3D PRINTING FACILITY Usually, a 4D printed structure is created by combining several materials in the appropriate distribution into a single, one-time printed structure. The differences in material properties, such as swelling ratio and thermal expansion coefficient, will lead to the desired shape shifting behaviour. Therefore, 3D printing is necessary for the fabrication of multi-material structures with simple geometry.\nSTIMULUS Stimulus is required to trigger the alterations of shape/property/functionality of a 4D printed structure. The stimuli that researchers have used in 4D printing thus far include water, heat, a combination of heat and light, and a combination of water and heat. The selection of the stimulus depends on the requirements of the specific application, which also determines the types of smart materials employed in the 4D printed structures.\nSTIMULUS RESPONSIVE MATERIAL Stimulus-responsive material is one of the most critical components of 4D printing. The capability of this group of materials is defined by the following characteristics: self-sensing, decision making, responsiveness, shape memory, self-adaptability, multi-functionality, and self-repair.\nINTERACTION MECHANISM In some cases, the desired shape of a 4D printed structure is not directly achieved by simply exposing the smart materials to the stimulus. The stimulus needs to be applied in a certain sequence under an appropriate amount of time, which is referred to as the interaction mechanism. For example, one of the main interaction mechanisms is constrained-thermo-mechanics. In this mechanism, the stimulus is heat and the smart material has the shape memory effect. It contains a 4- step cycle. First, the structure is deformed by an external load at a high temperature; second, the temperature is lowered while the external load is maintained; third, the structure is unloaded at the low temperature and the desired shape is achieved; fourth, the original shape can be recovered by reheating the structure.\nShape Shifting Behaviours The shape shifting behaviours include folding, bending, twisting, linear or nonlinear expansion/ contraction, surface curling, and the generation of surface topographical features such as wrinkles, creases, and buckles.\nSHAPE CHANGING VS. SHAPE MEMORY MATERIALS Shape shifting materials can be divided into two shape changing materials and shape memory materials. A shape changing material changes its shape immediately after a stimulus is applied, and returns to its permanent shape immediately after the stimulus is removed. Whereas shape memory material involves two step cycle, upon application of stimuli material is deformed from its primary shape to metastable temporary shape (programming step), followed by the recovery to primary shape on application of suitable stimuli (recovery step).\nDUAL, TRIPLE, AND MULTI SHAPE MEMORY EFFECTS A stimulus responsive shape memory material has the ability to memorize its permanent shape and on subjecting to stimulus deformation occurs between a permanent and temporary shape. A dual-SME material has one permanent shape and one temporary shape, while a triple-SME material has one permanent shape and two temporary shapes. Similarly, a multi (n)-SME material has one permanent shape and (n ‚àí1) temporary shapes.\nFOLDING VS. BENDING Bending is a global deformation associated with smoother curvatures, while folding is localized deformation that is associated with sharp angles occurring in a narrow hinge area in other words, bending relates to a distributed curvature, whereas folding is more localized.\nSURFACE TOPOGRAPHY It is the representation of local deviation of a surface from a flat plane. Typical features include wrinkling, creasing, and buckling. These features usually occur under compressive loading conditions.\nSHAPE-SHIFTING TYPES AND DIMENSIONS 1D-to-1D Expansion or Contraction It is also considered to be 4D printed structures since shape shifting occurs overtime. The stimulus is water and the 4D printed structure contains alternating layers of rigid discs and active hydrogels. After the structure is immersed in water, the hydrogel parts will swell while the rigid discs remain the same. By adjusting the ratio of expandable hydrogels to rigid discs, the structure can show linear shape-shifting behaviour with a desirable final length.\n1D-to-2D Folding There are two types of materials involved in the structure: rigid and active. The active material is a hydrogel that can swell when immersed in water while the rigid parts remain intact. This difference provides a stress mismatch and enables the overall shape to be changed toward a specific direction. The position and volume of the active and rigid materials in the structure can be designed to achieve different shape-shifting directions.\n1D-to-3D Folding The structure contains the same two materials described above. This is an illustration of 1Dto3D shape-shifting by self-folding mechanism. For each wireframe hinge, two rigid discs are embedded in the hydrogel part, which connects the two rigid strands. This is shown in Figure below. These two rigid discs can limit the maximum degree of free shape-shifting.\n2D-to-2D Bending 2D-to-2D self-bending in a 4D bio-printed networks of droplets. As shown in Fig a rectangular network could be bent into a circle. This shape-shifting behaviour is based on the differences in osmolarity of the droplets. The droplets with higher osmolarity swell and the droplets with lower osmolarity shrink. The shape continues to change until the osmolarity gradient becomes zero.\n2D-to-3D Bending A complex structure was created by tearing paper off of the flowerlike 3D structure. Heat is the stimulus in this shape-shifting behaviour. However, their experiment is different from the regular shape memory cycles with programming and recovery steps. In this mechanism, there is no need to apply external force at a high temperature and cool down to a low temperature while maintaining the previously applied force. The shape-shifting behaviour is enabled by different thermal expansion coefficients of the active and non-active materials.\n3D Folding 2D-to-3D shape-shifting behaviour based on self-folding. This shape-shifting behaviour is enabled by a stress mismatch between rigid and active materials due to their different swelling behaviours under water.\n2D-to-3D Twisting Here the fibers printed with certain angles to induce twisting, and by adjusting the print angles of active fibers, the final twist angle would be changed.\n2D-to-3D Bending and Twisting This is produced by the biomimetic 4D printing process shown in. This shape shifting behaviour is caused by the differences in the swelling ratios of active and rigid materials under water.\n3D-to-3D Bending This shape-shifting behaviour is triggered by dissolution of an appropriate material into a suitable solvent, which will be further discussed in the section discussing shape-shifting mechanisms and stimuli.\n3D-to-3D self-bending shape-shifting behaviour in a prosthetic finger made from thermoplastic elastomer (TPE).\nMaterial Structures The materials used in 4D printing are mainly classified into smart materials and conventional (nonsmart) material. In additive manufacturing, structures are divided into single-material and multimaterial structures. Further multi-material structures are classified into discrete multiple materials, composite materials, and porous materials. Another set of classification of multi material structure include uniform distribution, gradient distribution, and special patterns. Also, material structures can be classified as a structure with or without joints and hinges.\nMULTI-MATERIAL STRUCTURES In 4D printing, multiple materials usually need to be inserted into a single and one-time printed structure. This multi-material structure can be a mixture of different smart materials or a combination of smart materials and conventional materials. The single-material structure in 4D printing should always be fabricated with a smart material. In addition, it needs to be based on the structure with a gradient distribution of materials. The gradient distribution of a single material means that the density of the structure is different at various locations. This anisotropy can generate shape-shifting behaviours such as bending and twisting, which is beyond linear expansion and contraction.\nDIGITAL MATERIALS In nature, biological structures usually consist of fundamental building blocks that can be considered physical voxels, such as DNA and proteins. Physical 3D object is made of many digital units (voxels) arranged selectively in a 3D lattice, as opposed to analog (continuous) material commonly used in conventional. Digital material is defined as an assembly of various physical voxels. The spatial arrangement of voxels plays a major role in determining the features of a 4D-printed structure. In digital materials, each voxel contains only one material. Adjacent voxels can be composed of different materials. Each voxel has its own properties and the collection of different voxels results in the multi-material structure.\nMULTI-MATERIAL ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM To model the material structure in various length and time scales for digital materials, Myres (1999) developed a software called the Digital Material. Popescu (2006) proposed a new manufacturing process for digital materials that is reversible for disassembly and can reuse the building blocks of the structure. Huang (2016) demonstrated an approach for ultrafast printing of shape-shifting materials. Zhou (2013)reported that there are several limitations to the current 3D additive manufacturing process. For example, printers with inkjet nozzles can only print materials with certain viscosities and curing temperatures. The fused deposition modeling (FDM) process is relatively slow and has limited options for its minimum nozzle size. Zhou investigated several new techniques for digital material production using mask- imageprojection-based stereolithography. Ge (2016) provided an approach for printing multimaterial shape memory polymers (SMPs) with a high resolution (up to a few microns). This approach is enabled by a high-resolution projection microstereolithography (PŒºSL) additive manufacturing system with an automated material exchange mechanism. In order to enable 4D printing for biomedical applications, multi-material additive manufacturing systems that can print from aqueous mediums needs to be developed (Loh, 2016). In this regard, the direct-write (DW) printing technique (Lewis, Gratson \u0026amp; Lewis, Lebel), which is suitable for printing polymeric solutions, can be engaged.\n4D printing is the one of emerging technology which has a vast potential for growth. It will revolutionize most of the fields especially manufacturing industry, the stimulus responsive programming of these products will give a new horizon to packing and transportation sectors. The scope of assembling a product at required locations will be a huge step up.\nAlso, it will provide extensive support in the medical field with better accuracy the manufacturing of customized smart implants, tools and devices. organ printing, tissue engineering and selfassembling human scale biomaterials. It creates a development of biomedical splint, stents, bioprinting and orthodontics devices as per human growth. In the future, this emerging technology will become more beneficial and help to create endless possibilities in the medical field.\n4D printing has three main capabilities: self-assembly, multi-functionality, and self-repair; so, its application level is beyond imaginable, but the factors lacking are mainly availability of materials and a large amount of multidisciplinary research needs to be conducted in the future.\n","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/blogs/shape-shifting-behaviour-4d-materials/","title":"Shape Shifting Behaviour of 4D Printed Materials"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/tags/sustainable-material-studies/","title":"Sustainable Material Studies"},{"content":"Better Decision from Bitter Opinions ! Why criticism is good for you !\nCriticism means the expression of disagreement of someone or something that is based on perceived beliefs, faults and mistakes.\nNow the point is to consider whether it‚Äôs good or not. Taking criticism can be a difficult thing. Nobody likes to be told that something they have slaved over for days didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark. If we go by it‚Äôs meaning; to criticize someone is bad and even if you know some of your work probably deserved some extra love, criticism always stings.\nBut on the other hand, it may lead to improvement of the person being criticized and he becoming a better person, not repeating the mistakes again. At some point, even my writings ‚Äî are so dependant on reviews and opinions. Though one day you will encounter a customer or your audience and even a reviewer ‚Äî who wants to tell you how to do things better. But it‚Äôs not all bad news because sometimes you can use criticism to give you a competitive edge. It entirely depends upon the perceived value hidden behind the criticism.\nCriticism : a form of communication. If someone has a criticism for you; literally take it as they want to give you a feedback on what you are done or doing for them. We all make mistakes all the time, it is human nature. As we go through life we have plenty of opportunity to learn and improve ourselves. That means Criticism is an opportunity to learn more about the person who you‚Äôre working for and in case your a influencer or in business; how to convert them into a satisfied customer or audience member.\n ‚ÄúAny fool can criticize, condemn, and complain but it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving.‚Äù ‚Äî Dale Carnegie\n Generally speaking, there may be some truth behind each criticism you get; even it is given out on spite and bitterness. The criticism aimed at you may not make sense at the time, It is often the case that a slight change on your character is a fair reflection of how another person sees you at that point in time. So take a step-back, try to look from other‚Äôs perspective or ask the opinions of a honest friend, that will make you.\nCriticism : gives you a Competitive advantage. You cannot be sure whatever the critic is saying is right. Having heard him out, compare his statements or assessments with the facts on the ground. Sort out what is true from what is a biased statement and make objective analysis of them. Think about it : if you are a Salesperson and can get a customer to tell you ‚Äî and just you ‚Äî how to give them the perfect product or service, that‚Äôs information you‚Äôve got that no one else has. Even being a criticism too, the information you gets, puts you at an advantage over anyone else in your sector and can be used again in the future to get things right, even faster.\nIf you are open to suggestions around how you might approach things differently, you‚Äôll be perceived as a more authentic leader and it‚Äôll be easier for you to rally a team around a common goal or towards improving shared processes.\nThink Before Act. Don‚Äôt take it personally if someone doesn‚Äôt immediately like your work. Not everyone has pure motives when it comes to giving you feedback. If the criticism you‚Äôre receiving really stings, think about what that person is saying. Are they talking about something that directly influences the way you work or your behavior in a specific situation? Or are they more concerned about you come off as a person? The key thing to remember is that whatever the circumstance is, don¬¥t respond in anger as this will cause a scene and create bad feelings ‚Äî and possibly a bad image of you.\n Remember: when people tell you something‚Äôs wrong or doesn‚Äôt work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong. ‚Äî Neil Gaiman.\n There will be occasions when you feel the criticism is personal and, now and then, you‚Äôll be right.If feedback is based on something intrinsic to your personality, it‚Äôs not important enough to worry about. Criticism needs to be partnered with a solution to help you correct the action. If it‚Äôs not, the person is not interested in helping enough to warrant getting involved, literally it‚Äôs enough for them to shut up.They are also able to make it work to their advantage or, if all else fails, politely conclude the partnership and leave with their reputation intact.\nUnsure of how effectively you‚Äôre communicating? Try to transform your critical phrases into feedback that inspires change. May these words help you along !\nAlas, Enjoy reading !\n","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/notes/better-decision-bitter-opinions/","title":"Better Decision from Bitter Opinions"},{"content":"Everything i pendown, from stories to daily marathon; to be precise a venting place for my thoughts.\n","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/notes/","title":"Notes"},{"content":"Is it okay to show your Flaws When and how, i Fall in Love with My Flaws !

If my analogy hadn‚Äôt able to ‚Äòhit a hole‚Äô for you, lets try a different approach. In Japanese culture, there is an art form known as wabi-sabi. It has been around for centuries. When a plate becomes chipped or cracked, it is not discarded like trash. The cracks are filled with metallic materials to accentuate their details. Wabi-sabi celebrates imperfections because no two are exactly the same. You possess that uniqueness in your own life, and you should be proud of what it‚Äôs helped you become.\nOf course we all know how difficult it is to accept flaws. It‚Äôs a difficult thing to do when it comes to other people and when it comes to ourselves, well, it‚Äôs can seem nearly impossible. But, hard as it might seem, it is possible to love even the most flaws and it‚Äôs much essential to live a positive present life.\nBut to live so, First learn to love yourself for who you are! Loving yourself means loving even the not-so-great parts of yourself. Learning to love your flaws is going to be a constant battle, but that is a worth a fight.\nSo lets get to know how to fall in love with your Flaw. 1. Look For Something you can do about it. Foremost, you need to check whether if the flaws troubling is something you can actually do something for it, in case of flaws like ‚Äî bad temper or wicked impatience should not be accepted instead should work on. It‚Äôs not like throwing up your hands and saying, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the way I am!‚Äù. Ask Yourself : Does the flaw negatively impact you and others? Is there anything I can do to change it?\n2. Determine your actually going to do something. Only you know and you only will know, deep down whether the flaw bugs you or not, now it‚Äôs time to be brutally honest with yourself. If you‚Äôve determined that a flaw is to be changed. You can change it, but will you ? If you know it needs to be changed and you‚Äôre going to put in the effort, awesome! Go for it!\n3. View it in other‚Äôs Perspective. We‚Äôre so close to our flaws that they seem so much larger to us, i.e magnified by our own perception. The things you see as horrible or offensive might not look so bad when you try seeing them from an outsider‚Äôs point of view. In your mind, take a step back and try to imagine from other‚Äôs perspective about the flaw. When it comes, consider and contemplate how you would react to it when it is spotted on someone else. There you gets the clear image of your flaw.\n4. Accept for really what it is. Last but not least, accept your flaw for exactly what it is. After viewing from other person view and understanding about the flaw, now it‚Äôs time to take one step further ‚Äî simply accept it for what it is. Don‚Äôt compare it to others or rate it on a scale of good/bad. Strip it from all internal judgments; Accept it for what it is and realize that it is a part of you. Your flaws make you who you are, so embrace them!\nNow you should be on the road to either changing or loving your flaws, these steps allowed me to accept my flaws. Only you will know which flaw you should be working on and which one you need to accept and love. Remember Everyone has something, may be many he or she is flawed. But only Some people proactively choose to accept and love them.\nBe one among them.
