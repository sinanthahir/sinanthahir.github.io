Objective The goal of this project is to provide analysis on SpaceX launches, with focus on stage reuse and landings, to provide our company, SpaceY, competitive information on cost of launches and prediction methods on whether SpaceX will reuse a given stage.\nMethodology  Data collection:  SpaceX API: Past landing data, plus info on boosters, cores, payloads; Wikipedia scrape: Parse tables of past launches (including outcomes ‚Äî success/failure) into a DataFrame for next stage.   Data wrangling:  Outcomes (‚ÄúTrue ASDS‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrue Ocean‚Äù, etc.) grouped into two classes ‚Äî success (1) and failure (0); Column ‚Äòclass‚Äô added to DataFrame, to be used for model building and prediction.   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Visualization and SQL:  Data loaded into IBM Cloud DB2 instance; SQL queries run from Jupyter notebook; Plotly and Seaborn; categorical plots (scatter, bar, line); One-hot encoding of features.   Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash:  Folium maps + marker clusters: show launch sites; Dashboard: show successes for all launch sites, success percentage per site, and payload per launch.   Predictive analysis using classification models:  Split data between training and testing; Train and test 4 models: LogReg (logistic regression), SVM (support vector machine), Tree (decision tree), KNN (K nearest neighbors); Grid Search with a set of hyperparams; check model scores (R^2); build confusion matrix for each; ‚Äî\u0026gt; select best model.    Conclusions (Predictive Model)  Out of 4 prediction models (LogReg, SVM, Tree, KNN), SVM had the best accuracy on training data, and among the best at scores on test data. The Tree model appeared the weakest. Test vs Training data accuracy are not the same. The dataset is too small (only 90 observations) to distinguish any further between these models  See the Results üëá üìÅ Source Files üìù Report üåê Dashboard\n","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/works/spacex/","title":"Space X Landing Prediction"},{"content":"Experience Analysis through Weather Data Knowing accurate weather conditions is an important element for individuals as well as organizations. Many businesses rely on weather conditions. It is necessary to have the correct data to get accurate decisions. One type of data that‚Äôs easier to find on the internet is Weather data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters.\n The Analysis project was done as a part of my Data Analytics Internship at Suven Consultants \u0026amp; Technology.\n Objective The main objective is to perform data cleaning, perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming on temperature and humidity, and finally put forth a conclusion.\nHypothesis The Null Hypothesis H0 is ‚ÄúHas the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming‚Äù ‚Äî That means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month says April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.\nSee the Results üëá üìÅ Source Files üìù Report\n","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/works/weather/","title":"Weather Data Analysis"},{"content":"Itiha 2k18 Itiha 2K18, National Techno-Cultural Fest of Rajadhani Institute of Engineering and Technology, Trivandrum hosted on March 8th, 9th and 10th, 2018.
