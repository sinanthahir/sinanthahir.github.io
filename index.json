Objective The goal of this project is to provide analysis on SpaceX launches, with focus on stage reuse and landings, to provide our company, SpaceY, competitive information on cost of launches and prediction methods on whether SpaceX will reuse a given stage.\nMethodology  Data collection:  SpaceX API: Past landing data, plus info on boosters, cores, payloads; Wikipedia scrape: Parse tables of past launches (including outcomes ‚Äî success/failure) into a DataFrame for next stage.   Data wrangling:  Outcomes (‚ÄúTrue ASDS‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrue Ocean‚Äù, etc.) grouped into two classes ‚Äî success (1) and failure (0); Column ‚Äòclass‚Äô added to DataFrame, to be used for model building and prediction.   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Visualization and SQL:  Data loaded into IBM Cloud DB2 instance; SQL queries run from Jupyter notebook; Plotly and Seaborn; categorical plots (scatter, bar, line); One-hot encoding of features.   Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash:  Folium maps + marker clusters: show launch sites; Dashboard: show successes for all launch sites, success percentage per site, and payload per launch.   Predictive analysis using classification models:  Split data between training and testing; Train and test 4 models: LogReg (logistic regression), SVM (support vector machine), Tree (decision tree), KNN (K nearest neighbors); Grid Search with a set of hyperparams; check model scores (R^2); build confusion matrix for each; ‚Äî\u0026gt; select best model.    Conclusions (Predictive Model)  Out of 4 prediction models (LogReg, SVM, Tree, KNN), SVM had the best accuracy on training data, and among the best at scores on test data. The Tree model appeared the weakest. Test vs Training data accuracy are not the same. The dataset is too small (only 90 observations) to distinguish any further between these models  See the Results üëá üìÅ Source Files üìù Report üåê Dashboard\n","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/works/spacex/","title":"Space X Landing Prediction"},{"content":"Experience Analysis through Weather Data Knowing accurate weather conditions is an important element for individuals as well as organizations. Many businesses rely on weather conditions. It is necessary to have the correct data to get accurate decisions. One type of data that‚Äôs easier to find on the internet is Weather data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters.\n The Analysis project was done as a part of my Data Analytics Internship at Suven Consultants \u0026amp; Technology.\n Objective The main objective is to perform data cleaning, perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming on temperature and humidity, and finally put forth a conclusion.\nHypothesis The Null Hypothesis H0 is ‚ÄúHas the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming‚Äù ‚Äî That means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month says April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.\nSee the Results üëá üìÅ Source Files üìù Report\n","permalink":"https://sinanthahir.github.io/works/weather/","title":"Weather Data Analysis"},{"content":"Itiha 2k18 Itiha 2K18, National Techno-Cultural Fest of Rajadhani Institute of Engineering and Technology, Trivandrum hosted on March 8th, 9th and 10th, 2018.

You‚Äôll discover who you are; unless you‚Äôve tried it. Living in this world with 7.8 Billion others, you hear that number; each individual with there own life story and putting each one‚Äôs creativeness forward to paper in your solace; can actually be a relief and thus a new writer is born.\nWriting a book considered as a skill but for me it‚Äôs upskilling. Listen, everyone can be a writer. Each one of us have a story to share. In fact, more stories to put forward. But the truth to write these stories, first you need to start write. Here come the prior stepping stones‚Äì Dedication and Passion.\nBy its very nature, Writing is an introspective and thoughtful activity. You don‚Äôt have to complete a book in a month or two; take your time. The more time you take in writing, the more you experience. If you‚Äôre an amateur, starting to write ‚Äî go for your trajectory of life. Many people think they need to do something massive or be famous to write about their life, That‚Äôs not truth at all. The reason behind writing about your life is that you have a real story; something worth changing lives of others with your trial and tribulations.\nEven you aren‚Äôt ready for a memoir, thou still have a valuable piece of short influential timeline, experiences or the knowledge gained that can help others; can be pen downed. It‚Äôs hard to peek inside, one of the hardest things in our life is to look inside ourselves. The harder you self-reflect, the more you discover who you been these all time. It can be objected a time when we evaluate ourselves.\nNot to mention writing a memoir. The most important thing to write a book about yourself is to get really, really honest and dig into the raw and deep parts about yourself. Nobody wants a book about you that‚Äôs all sunshine and rainbows because that‚Äôs not real life.\nIf You‚Äôre writing about yourself, here are some tips.  Decide what you need to write about yourself or a part of it. Self-reflect your own life Specify the experiences you want to share Create a mind-map of experience to connect Take those ideas and starts to write an outline.  Through writing, you‚Äôll gain perspective towards what really matters you. It will also teach you, the unique value of your own willpower.\nWriting a book is a way to touch your thoughts, values, and motivations. This simple act of writing can perish to measure the depths of your discipline and efforts. Because, writing is cheaper than a therapy.\nAll that counts is that you get your first word on paper, and then a word after that. You owe it to yourself to explore your passion and write a book. When you‚Äôre writing about something you love, it won‚Äôt feel like work.\nNow comes the hectic, tasks of drafting and publishing.\n A shady statistic, only 1% of world population ever publishes a book.\n No matter what you write a book about, whether you published it or not; that you write will open the door to your inwards or for more ideas. You‚Äôll educate yourself on a broad array of ideas to tackle more obstacles, Life thrown at you.\nWriting a book is leaving your comfort zone. The only way you grow as a person is by forcing yourself to leave your comfort zone.\nTime to touch the sky‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwrite a book yourselves. Discover who you really are.\n This article was original published on Medium dated Sep 15, 2020.
