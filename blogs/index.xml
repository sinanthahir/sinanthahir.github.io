      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;experience-analysis-through-weather-data--exploratory-data-analysis&#34;&gt;Experience Analysis through Weather Data : Exploratory Data Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;cover.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing accurate weather conditions is an important element for individuals as well as organizations. Many businesses rely on weather conditions. It is necessary to have the correct data to get accurate decisions. One type of data that’s easier to find on the internet is Weather data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyze data, to summarize the main characteristics of data, and better understand the data set. It also allows us to quickly interpret the data and adjust different variables to see their effect. The three main steps to get a perfect EDA are &lt;code&gt;extracting&lt;/code&gt; the data from an authorized source, &lt;code&gt;cleaning&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;processing&lt;/code&gt; the data, and performing data &lt;code&gt;visualization&lt;/code&gt; on the cleaned data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I will work through out a practical exploratory data analysis which was done a part of my data analytics internship at &lt;a href=&#34;https://suvenconsultants.com/&#34;&gt;Suven Consultants &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus of our project was to perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming and finally put forth a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hypothesis&#34;&gt;Hypothesis:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hypothesis is an assumption, an idea that is proposed for the sake of argument so that it can be tested to see if it might be true.






    
    


&lt;div class=&#34;rounded p-3 my-6&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #d9edf7; color: #31708f;&#34; &gt;
    
The Null Hypothesis H0 is “Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming”

&lt;/div&gt;

That means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month says April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, What is this Apparent Temperature and Humidity mentioned in the Null Hypothesis (H0)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are called Terminologies, or rather say the column names or criteria used to constrain the data we have to different specification or class. In order to know that we must look up for basic terminologies used in the data we are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terminologies&#34;&gt;Terminologies:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meteorological Data&lt;/strong&gt; refers to data consisting of physical parameters that are measured directly by instrumentation, and include temperature, dew point, wind direction, wind speed, cloud cover, cloud layer(s), ceiling height, visibility, current weather, and precipitation amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apparent temperature&lt;/strong&gt; is the temperature equivalent perceived by humans, caused by the combined effects of air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The measure is most commonly applied to the perceived outdoor temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humidity&lt;/strong&gt; is the amount of water vapor in the air. If there is a lot of water vapor in the air, the humidity will be high. The higher the humidity, the wetter it feels outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out more weather terminologies from &lt;a href=&#34;https://kestrelmeters.com/pages/weather-glossary&#34;&gt;Kestrelmeter’s Glossary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dataset&#34;&gt;Dataset:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset currently using, can be obtained from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset&#34;&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;. The dataset has hourly temperature recorded for the last 10 years starting from 2006–04–01 00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016–09–09 23:00:00.000 +0200. It corresponds to Finland, a country in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have our Objective, Dataset, and basic understanding of the Terminologies. So let’s start of journey to analyze the data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-preprocessing&#34;&gt;Data Preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, i’m using Anaconda Environment with Visual Studio Code. You can also set up such a system which enable a faster git and pipeline integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;importing-required-libraries&#34;&gt;Importing required libraries:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;loading-dataset&#34;&gt;Loading dataset:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load the dataset using &lt;code&gt;read_csv()&lt;/code&gt; function as the dataset is in CSV form and read the first 5 rows from data using &lt;code&gt;head()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data = pd.read_csv(&#39;weatherHistory.csv&#39;)
data.head()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;01.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimensions&lt;/strong&gt; of the dataframe refers to the overall data sample, i.e, the total number of rows and columns in the data. It can be obtained using &lt;code&gt;data.shape&lt;/code&gt; function as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.shape
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total number of rows and columns in the data set is &lt;strong&gt;96453&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out the types and overall summary of the data frame, we use the &lt;code&gt;data.info()&lt;/code&gt; function. It comes in handy when doing exploratory analysis of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.info()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;00.png&#34; alt=&#34;info_output&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;describe()&lt;/code&gt; function to get the descriptive statistical details of the data-frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.describe()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;03.png&#34; alt=&#34;stat&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check the distinct elements in the data frame, we can use the &lt;code&gt;nunique()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.nunique()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;04.png&#34; alt=&#34;nunique&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can check for any missing values using the &lt;code&gt;isnull()&lt;/code&gt; function. since having a large dataset, we can incorporate &lt;code&gt;sum()&lt;/code&gt; function to get the total number of missing value in each columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.isnull().sum()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;05.png&#34; alt=&#34;isnull&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till now, we had got up many details about the dataset we are working on. Lets take it into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observations&#34;&gt;Observations:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ‘&lt;em&gt;Precip Type&lt;/em&gt;’, there are 517 missing values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;Wind Bearing (degrees)&lt;/em&gt;’ has only integer values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formatted Date&lt;/strong&gt; is in String.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum values of Humidity, Wind Speed (km/h), Wind Bearing (degrees), Visibility (km) are &lt;strong&gt;Zero&lt;/strong&gt; and they can be &lt;strong&gt;Zero&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Statistical details and Distinct Elements in Dataframe, It is noticed that ’Loud Cover’ are &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;null&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can &lt;em&gt;remove the unwanted columns&lt;/em&gt; which don’t add value to the analysis using the &lt;strong&gt;drop()&lt;/strong&gt; function. We will drop ‘Loud Cover’ as it has one unique value 0 and it is not useful in analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data = data.drop([‘Loud Cover’], axis = 1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;correlation-of-the-columns&#34;&gt;Correlation of the Columns:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation matrices are an essential tool of exploratory data analysis. We can display the pairwise correlation using &lt;code&gt;corr()&lt;/code&gt; function which creates the correlation matrix between all the features in the dataset. &lt;strong&gt;Correlation heatmaps&lt;/strong&gt; contain the same information in a visually appealing way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# assign data correlation matrix
relation = data.corr()

# Increase the size of the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))

# Store heatmap object in a variable to easily access it
when you want to include more features and you can set 
the annotation parameter to True to display the 
correlation values on the heatmap.
sns.heatmap(data=relation)

# Give a title to the heatmap.
plt.title(&amp;quot;Correlation of columns in the dataframe&amp;quot;)

# save the figure.
plt.savefig(&#39;plot1.png&#39;, dpi=300, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;)
plt.show()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;06.png&#34; alt=&#34;heatmap&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation&#34;&gt;Observation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Pairwise correlation chart, we can see that &lt;em&gt;Apparent Temperature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Humidity&lt;/em&gt; have a high degree of correlation with each other. So we have a high chance of validating our hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only need 3 columns for checking and validating our task which is data &lt;strong&gt;[‘Formatted Date’, ‘Apparent Temperature(c)’, ‘Humidity’]&lt;/strong&gt;. So, we can ignore other columns and missing values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parsing-dates-creating-new-dataframe-&#34;&gt;Parsing Dates, Creating new dataframe :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the ‘Formatted Date’ feature from String to Datetime using the &lt;code&gt;datetime()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data[‘Formatted Date’] = pd.to_datetime(data[‘Formatted Date’],utc=True)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can set “Formatted Date” as an index using the &lt;code&gt;set_index()&lt;/code&gt; function which sets the DataFrame index (row labels) using one or more existing columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data = data.set_index(“Formatted Date”)
data.info()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;07.png&#34; alt=&#34;parsed&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;resampling-data&#34;&gt;Resampling Data:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resampling&lt;/strong&gt; is a convenient method for frequency conversion. The object must have a datetime like an index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have hourly data, we need to resample it to monthly. We only require the Apparent Temperature and humidity columns to test the hypothesis. So, we will consider these two columns and perform a &lt;code&gt;resample()&lt;/code&gt; function from Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df_column = [&#39;Apparent Temperature (C)&#39;, &#39;Humidity&#39;]
df_monthly_mean = data[df_column].resample(&amp;quot;MS&amp;quot;).mean() 
#MS-Month Starting
df_monthly_mean.head()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we converts hourly data to monthly data using “&lt;strong&gt;MS&lt;/strong&gt;” which denotes the Month starting. We are displaying the average apparent temperature and humidity using the &lt;strong&gt;mean()&lt;/strong&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;08.png&#34; alt=&#34;resample&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are done with cleaning and resampling it. Now, Lets begin our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relation-between-apparent-temperature--humidity-using-regression&#34;&gt;Relation between Apparent Temperature &amp;amp; Humidity Using Regression:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;regplot()&lt;/code&gt; function to plot the relationship between the “Apparent Temperature ” and “Humidity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# calling regplot function and assign it with our data and plot labels and color parameter.
sns.regplot(data=df_monthly_mean, x=&amp;quot;Apparent Temperature (C)&amp;quot;, y=&amp;quot;Humidity&amp;quot;, color=&amp;quot;r&amp;quot;)

# Give a title to the plot
plt.title(&amp;quot;Relation between Apparent Temperature (C) and Humidity&amp;quot;)

# save the figure
plt.savefig(&#39;plot2.png&#39;, dpi=300, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;)
plt.show()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;09.png&#34; alt=&#34;regplot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation-1&#34;&gt;Observation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Linear Relation between “&lt;em&gt;Apparent Temperature&lt;/em&gt; ” and “&lt;em&gt;Humidity&lt;/em&gt;” with a &lt;strong&gt;negative&lt;/strong&gt; slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, and its relative humidity decreases. When temperatures drop, relative humidity increases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yearly-variation-of-apparent-temperature-and-humidity&#34;&gt;Yearly Variation of Apparent Temperature and Humidity:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;lineplot()&lt;/code&gt; function to plot the Variation of Apparent Temperature and Humidity with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plt.figure(figsize=(15,7))
sns.lineplot(data= df_monthly_mean)
plt.xlabel(&#39;year&#39;)
plt.title(&#39;Variation of Apparent Temprature and HUmidity with Time&#39;)
plt.savefig(&#39;plot3.png&#39;, dpi=300, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;)
plt.show()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;10.png&#34; alt=&#34;var&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above graph displays average temperature and humidity for all 12 months over the 10 years i.e., from 2006 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation-2&#34;&gt;Observation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Humidity&lt;/em&gt;” remained constant from 2006–2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Apparent Temperature&lt;/em&gt;” changed from 2006–2016 at regular intervals with constant amplitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;variation-of-humidity--apparent-temperature-for-all-months&#34;&gt;Variation of Humidity &amp;amp; Apparent Temperature for all months:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a function which labels each month number with actual &lt;strong&gt;month name&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;specified color&lt;/em&gt; for graph. and defining a seaborn &lt;code&gt;plot()&lt;/code&gt; function. This function helps to analyze the variations in Apparent Temperature and Humidity for all months over the 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Defining a function call for month to be labeled
def label_color(month):
    if month == 1:
       return &#39;January&#39;,&#39;black&#39;
    elif month == 2:

    elif month == 4:

    elif month == 11:
       return &#39;November&#39;,&#39;purple&#39;
    else:
       return &#39;December&#39;,&#39;green&#39;

# Assigning variables to resampled data

    plt.show()

# Plot for the month of &#39;January - December&#39;
for month in range(1,13):
    sns_month_plot(month)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphs below show the variations in Apparent Temperature and Humidity for each month from 2006 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;january&#34;&gt;January&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;13.png&#34; alt=&#34;jan&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;february&#34;&gt;February&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;14.png&#34; alt=&#34;feb&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;march&#34;&gt;March&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;15.png&#34; alt=&#34;mar&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation-3&#34;&gt;Observation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As from the above plots, we can understand that, ’The Apparent Temperature’ has a tremendous fluctuation over the time period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a sharp rise of temperature between year 2008–2009 which again decreases in year 2009–2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is observed that the average Apparent Temperature is at its peak in year 2009 which further drops to its lowest in year 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas the average Humidity has remained nearly constant over the period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this analysis, We can conclude that the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming. This clears that our &lt;em&gt;Null Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; is having a &lt;strong&gt;True positive&lt;/strong&gt; impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do more analysis on the data, the more we question the data, the better we know about it. You can create more and more Hypothesis to verify more about your objective. You can also create a weather prediction model; using this data to train and test your model. It’s all up to you. That is one of the best thing about exploratory data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

“ Augmented Reality — Enhancing flow of everyday life ”

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook’s Full AR glasses are much away from reaching to our hands, but had started there road-test mapping with Cluster of sensors or to particularly say a ‘Sensory array’ debut research device in Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area. A group of 100 Facebook employees and others getting hands on these, testing and for the thrive for data collection. The company announced the news Wednesday at its virtual &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebookconnect.com/en&#34;&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt; conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-is-this-project-aria-&#34;&gt;So what is this PROJECT ARIA ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Project Aria, Facebook’s Reality Labs is trying to vision a future device free flow into the everyday life expect for the pair of glasses. these are not just the ordinary glasses, but a Augmented Reality Wearable. As Facebook says these pair of glasses adds a 3D layer of useful, relevant and meaningful information on top of our physical world. they projects out examples like- “Imagine calling a friend and chatting with their lifelike avatar across the table. Imagine a digital assistant smart enough to detect road hazards, offer up stats during a business meeting, or even help you hear better in a noisy environment”. It paves the way for doing the everyday task at a better way and opens up an entirely new way of moving through the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNPMEU6OqIs&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/&#34;&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; an advanced stand-alone VR headset, is one of the Facebook’s Current Immersive Product on the market. But there AR ambition are going much a further way; The company is looking forward in creating a spatial scan of the real word called &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/projectaria/&#34;&gt;Live Map&lt;/a&gt; which will in-turn creates a better relation with people and other objects, giving a sense to the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Facebook’s Reality Lab envisions to provide a better connectivity with no look downs to your devices. They are looking to a world where the device itself disappears in to the flow of life. Thus Project Aria is a new research project that will help us build the first generation of wearable AR devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdj9U0pyem4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook says “To actually build glasses flexible enough to work for most face shapes and sizes, and create the software to support them, we still need &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebooks-chief-scientist-mass-adoption-of-ar-is-years-away&#34;&gt;several generations of breakthroughs&lt;/a&gt;, like systems to enhance audio and visual input, contextualized AI, and a lightweight frame to house it all”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-visionary-research-tool-&#34;&gt;A visionary research tool !&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook puts into light that ‘The Project Aria glasses are not a consumer product, nor are they a prototype’ but a step into the future step in AR efforts. They are looking forward for a research device that will help us understand how to build the software and hardware necessary for AR glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zue1pxGJnvg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Aria glasses use sensors to capture video and audio from the wearer’s point of view, as well as eye movement and location data to help our engineers and programmers figure out how AR glasses can work in practice.but that information will be held on-device and not be seen by Facebook researchers before blurring the data of faces and sensitive information like car license plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook plans to train an AI Assistant adapted for the glasses usage through the smart spatial audio technology. they also plans in refining the Livemaps; which will provide a 3D array of data and be a backbone for navigation through these glasses.They are practically improving the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ai.facebook.com/blog/new-milestones-in-embodied-ai/&#34;&gt;embodied AI&lt;/a&gt; through these glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first test run is set offed, Project Aria glasses are initially be made available to a limited group of Facebook employees and contractors in the United States, trained in both where and when to use the device, and where and when not to. Project Aria is most definitely not an actual pair of smartglasses. It’s a “sensor array” for those future glasses. Facebook’s post on Aria says it will have “the full sensor suite used in VR headsets for spatial awareness,” adding, “they also compute location from GPS, take high-res pictures, and capture multichannel audio and eye images”. But the intersection of the real world and the data-collecting challenges smartglasses pose sounds like an extremely tricky problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;privacy-matters-&#34;&gt;Privacy Matters !&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is promising to take care with data on the glasses. The testers are reportedly being instructed on how to use these devices responsibly. But the glasses will be tested lots of public spaces. In privately owned public places they’re supposed to get consent before recording. The data being recorded is encrypted and then Facebook uses a “secure ingestion system to upload data from the devices to a separate, designated storage space, accessible only to researchers with approved access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public-collected data will “not be used to inform the ads people see across Facebook’s apps,” Facebook’s Project Aria privacy guidelines say. But that also suggests that, eventually, information on AR headsets could be used to target ads. It would be dealt with in the near AR future amidst not now. You can view the &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/projectaria/privacy-policy/&#34;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; guidelines by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;Challenges!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook say’s “The biggest initial challenge they are facing is to finding a way to take all of the existing sensors necessary to make AR work, and fitting them on a pair of glasses that participants could actually wear.” not only the design specification but also a more number of problem to be solved like Heat dissipated from micro-computers used, better wireless connectivity provision, light weight frames, better battery life to run all day long, a framework for storing and indexing your virtual objects( virtual co-ordinates ) placed by the user to another user’s view, preparing a well developed navigation which see’s better and understand the surroundings ; as a wearable, the contrast ratio correction as moving from sun to dark workplaces, varying focal lengths suitable for various peoples, better field view even with the 3D layer infographics . As Bosworth says “This is a playground of challenging problems” , yes purely a many number solution is yet need to be founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward&#34;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook in one hand is really looking for providing an evolutionary research in AR — making a better flow in the everyday life. Though the privacy matters are really a complicated weird line, if it is from Facebook. However the Facebook’s view “for a world with fewer devices and more time spent enjoying moments with family and friends, where opportunity is defined by passions, not geography or circumstance” sounds like a better tomorrow .&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-and-ml--shaping-the-new-automotive-era&#34;&gt;AI and ML : Shaping the New Automotive Era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Artificial intelligence living in every vehicle will become our reality before you know it.”&lt;/p&gt;






    
    


&lt;div class=&#34;rounded p-3 my-6&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #d9edf7; color: #31708f;&#34; &gt;
    
Frank Borman once said “Exploration is really the essence of the human spirit.”

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there lies no mistake at all, we are exploring only at a very starting verge of AI and ML ‘s potentials in the new era of industries. Many of the technologies like Data Science, Text Mining, Neural Networking and Machine Learning are partially embedded in e-commerce, financial and online social platforms. Soon it will show its much dominance in manufacturing and automotive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day by day the technology evolves, so does the automotive with its trends and discoveries. We can’t barely imagine a day without riding our own vehicle or hopping on some kind of public transport. From the recent AI developments proved that artificial intelligence will soon transform every device we’re using. That means even your vehicle too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people thoughts that AI application in Automotive means the creation of auto-driving cars, still more advancement can be taken up for a better user end product. So, let’s take a dive into what are the ways &lt;strong&gt;AI application evolves the automotive industry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;driver-assist&#34;&gt;Driver Assist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI-based driver assistants bring massive changes to the navigation and safety measures on the road. It is an easy aid for those in-experienced and diverted in middle of driving, but also enhances the communication between the car and its owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a plenty of real-time monitoring sensors, these AI assist can check blind zones, measure the exact distance to objects, and prevent emergencies from happening thereby saving lives on the road. These Assist software, in-fact can alert the driver behavior through monitoring drivers sitting posture, eye closings and much more. The best part of such driver assist AI application functionality is that, it can be customized according to the driver’s needs — Ambulances, fire engines, public transports and school buses each have its own peculiarities and AI can do all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;autopilot-driving&#34;&gt;Autopilot Driving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since some-what time, people actually rely on the driver assistance— entrusting their safety and well-being. The idea of self-driving cars isn’t new, it’s the rapid development in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence made it possible. Although the fact of car driving its own and the actual driver becoming the passenger is shocking and feared by many. But thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tesla.com/autopilot&#34;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://waymo.com/tech/&#34;&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; turns this fiction into an absolute inevitable reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all about the big data AI should process while driving much what to be like an experienced driver; pressing the pedals and following the GPS tips is simply not enough. Hopefully the higher competition in this area and innovative developments in both AI and Automotive industries will really bring us some high-performing solutions in the nearest future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-and-connective&#34;&gt;Cloud and Connective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best application of cloud integration in the automotive industry is the car connectivity through an internet access/ Wlan on board. With these applications, the cars can connect to a network and even with other cars; transmitting the generated data to the cloud and accessing it, increases a lot benefits to all road users such as certain condition in each location, data to manufactures about vehicle evaluation and maintenance and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;planned-maintenance&#34;&gt;Planned Maintenance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the gas indicators to the distance compiler, checking on every monitors and sensors; your car basically knows what is about to happen with AI running. Thus, Car Cloud Connectivity takes Maintenance to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI assistant with cloud integration; not only gathers the real-time data, but also stores every single record of data for future analytics and statistics. AI can analyse for Car performance and predict component failures, so vehicle manufacturers and owners can work proactively to avoid problems. Since it connects the manufacture to the consumer end increasing a more problem-solving environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seamless Cloud experience is now under construction named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/02/volkswagen-and-microsoft-share-progress-on-strategic-partnership.html&#34;&gt;Volkswagen Cloud Experience&lt;/a&gt; by Microsoft and Volkswagen which intended in saving natural resources and increasing road safety while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;individualized-marketing&#34;&gt;Individualized marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about it is that AI in your car software doesn’t complicate the user experience whatsoever It can also provide drivers with location‑based information and personalized advertising to help them find the things they need. This puts companies into a position when they have to look for marketing channels that would not overwhelm their potential customers, and connected AI automotive assistants come in hand here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud platform with AI driven is in close with driver and able to analyze consumer preference, action on roads and stops. This help the big companies with data, that can really able to make predictive marketing campaigns and advertisements for capturing the target audience basing on the location and personal preferences. A driver can get instant notifications about sales or some good deals on his way while driving. The same goes with a low fuel level or a need to visit the service, the AI assistant will notify about the gas station and car service on the driver’s route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-assessment&#34;&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having access to driver’s recent life events, analyzing his actions in road and more can in turn make Artificial Intelligence to find out any typical future threats to the driver. Suck risk profiles are much accurate since AI take into account of low lifestyle factors too. So with the Combination of Insurance Industry with the Connected Car Cloud, the possibility of better service can be retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-and-ml-in-manufacturing&#34;&gt;AI and ML in Manufacturing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data generated by the many sensors now embedded in vehicles, extracted from the design and development phase through to testing and production to marketing and compiled from customer feedback are powerful sources of information. Their analysis and interpretation provide equally powerful levers for improvement in design, testing and maintenance; as well as for understanding user needs and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robotics in manufacturing isn’t new to anyone these days, however, the AI applications at car manufacturing are not that spread yet. Market leaders are currently occupied with these AI applied Robotics in manufacturing plants since the potential cost of implementation is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly in the warehouse management, the most high-end car manufacturers also use robots to collect, move, and sort items shortening the manual labor, as well as take part in vehicle assembly building.Some robots can also detect inaccuracies and defects on the car surface The technology behind smart robots is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping&#34;&gt;Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)&lt;/a&gt; — a computational method of constructing a map of an unknown environment and navigation in it. Some preset algorithm in robots are used in order in manufacturing wielding , exterior painting and so on, which drastically reduce manual labors and up-cycling time and rate of manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these preset and movable robots, research are lead by many top-end manufacturing company look out for exoskeleton wearable industrial robots to protect human workers, making them a lot stronger while keeping their mobility at max. A working bay of car manufacture can lead to many potential hazards to the workers due to the heavy machinery and circuitry network, so such equipment is a huge step forward to a safer working bay. Examples of exoskeleton development are &lt;strong&gt;Hyundai Vest Exoskeleton (H-VEX)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hyundai Vest Exoskeleton (H-CEX)&lt;/strong&gt; actively used by Kia Motors at their factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day by day, there is a tremendous amount of automotive increase in every part of the world, for e.g. Asia has 141% more cars than it has a decade ago. As the more crowded the road , more will be the risk factors. Today’s Automotive industries cannot only rely on Quality and driver cautious. Artificial intelligence stack of improved technology for every car is a significant step towards our safety and positive experience for each car users of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
