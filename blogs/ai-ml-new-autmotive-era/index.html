<p>“Artificial intelligence living in every vehicle will become our reality before you know it.”</p>






    
    


<div class="rounded p-3 my-6" style="background-color: #d9edf7; color: #31708f;" >
    
Frank Borman once said “Exploration is really the essence of the human spirit.”

</div>

<p>So there lies no mistake at all, we are exploring only at a very starting verge of AI and ML ‘s potentials in the new era of industries. Many of the technologies like Data Science, Text Mining, Neural Networking and Machine Learning are partially embedded in e-commerce, financial and online social platforms. Soon it will show its much dominance in manufacturing and automotive sectors.</p>
<p>Day by day the technology evolves, so does the automotive with its trends and discoveries. We can’t barely imagine a day without riding our own vehicle or hopping on some kind of public transport. From the recent AI developments proved that artificial intelligence will soon transform every device we’re using. That means even your vehicle too.</p>
<p>Many people thoughts that AI application in Automotive means the creation of auto-driving cars, still more advancement can be taken up for a better user end product. So, let’s take a dive into what are the ways <strong>AI application evolves the automotive industry</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="driver-assist">Driver Assist</h3>
<p>AI-based driver assistants bring massive changes to the navigation and safety measures on the road. It is an easy aid for those in-experienced and diverted in middle of driving, but also enhances the communication between the car and its owner.</p>
<p>With a plenty of real-time monitoring sensors, these AI assist can check blind zones, measure the exact distance to objects, and prevent emergencies from happening thereby saving lives on the road. These Assist software, in-fact can alert the driver behavior through monitoring drivers sitting posture, eye closings and much more. The best part of such driver assist AI application functionality is that, it can be customized according to the driver’s needs — Ambulances, fire engines, public transports and school buses each have its own peculiarities and AI can do all.</p>
<h3 id="autopilot-driving">Autopilot Driving</h3>
<p>Since some-what time, people actually rely on the driver assistance— entrusting their safety and well-being. The idea of self-driving cars isn’t new, it’s the rapid development in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence made it possible. Although the fact of car driving its own and the actual driver becoming the passenger is shocking and feared by many. But thanks to <a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot">Tesla</a> and <a href="https://waymo.com/tech/">Waymo</a> turns this fiction into an absolute inevitable reality.</p>
<p>It’s all about the big data AI should process while driving much what to be like an experienced driver; pressing the pedals and following the GPS tips is simply not enough. Hopefully the higher competition in this area and innovative developments in both AI and Automotive industries will really bring us some high-performing solutions in the nearest future.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-and-connective">Cloud and Connective</h3>
<p>The best application of cloud integration in the automotive industry is the car connectivity through an internet access/ Wlan on board. With these applications, the cars can connect to a network and even with other cars; transmitting the generated data to the cloud and accessing it, increases a lot benefits to all road users such as certain condition in each location, data to manufactures about vehicle evaluation and maintenance and much more.</p>
<h3 id="planned-maintenance">Planned Maintenance</h3>
<p>From the gas indicators to the distance compiler, checking on every monitors and sensors; your car basically knows what is about to happen with AI running. Thus, Car Cloud Connectivity takes Maintenance to a whole new level.</p>
<p>AI assistant with cloud integration; not only gathers the real-time data, but also stores every single record of data for future analytics and statistics. AI can analyse for Car performance and predict component failures, so vehicle manufacturers and owners can work proactively to avoid problems. Since it connects the manufacture to the consumer end increasing a more problem-solving environment.</p>
<p>A seamless Cloud experience is now under construction named <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/02/volkswagen-and-microsoft-share-progress-on-strategic-partnership.html">Volkswagen Cloud Experience</a> by Microsoft and Volkswagen which intended in saving natural resources and increasing road safety while driving.</p>
<h3 id="individualized-marketing">Individualized marketing</h3>
<p>The best thing about it is that AI in your car software doesn’t complicate the user experience whatsoever It can also provide drivers with location‑based information and personalized advertising to help them find the things they need. This puts companies into a position when they have to look for marketing channels that would not overwhelm their potential customers, and connected AI automotive assistants come in hand here.</p>
<p>The cloud platform with AI driven is in close with driver and able to analyze consumer preference, action on roads and stops. This help the big companies with data, that can really able to make predictive marketing campaigns and advertisements for capturing the target audience basing on the location and personal preferences. A driver can get instant notifications about sales or some good deals on his way while driving. The same goes with a low fuel level or a need to visit the service, the AI assistant will notify about the gas station and car service on the driver’s route.</p>
<h3 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>Having access to driver’s recent life events, analyzing his actions in road and more can in turn make Artificial Intelligence to find out any typical future threats to the driver. Suck risk profiles are much accurate since AI take into account of low lifestyle factors too. So with the Combination of Insurance Industry with the Connected Car Cloud, the possibility of better service can be retained.</p>
<h3 id="ai-and-ml-in-manufacturing">AI and ML in Manufacturing</h3>
<p>The data generated by the many sensors now embedded in vehicles, extracted from the design and development phase through to testing and production to marketing and compiled from customer feedback are powerful sources of information. Their analysis and interpretation provide equally powerful levers for improvement in design, testing and maintenance; as well as for understanding user needs and expectations.</p>
<p>Robotics in manufacturing isn’t new to anyone these days, however, the AI applications at car manufacturing are not that spread yet. Market leaders are currently occupied with these AI applied Robotics in manufacturing plants since the potential cost of implementation is high.</p>
<p>Similarly in the warehouse management, the most high-end car manufacturers also use robots to collect, move, and sort items shortening the manual labor, as well as take part in vehicle assembly building.Some robots can also detect inaccuracies and defects on the car surface The technology behind smart robots is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping">Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)</a> — a computational method of constructing a map of an unknown environment and navigation in it. Some preset algorithm in robots are used in order in manufacturing wielding , exterior painting and so on, which drastically reduce manual labors and up-cycling time and rate of manufacturing.</p>
<p>In addition to these preset and movable robots, research are lead by many top-end manufacturing company look out for exoskeleton wearable industrial robots to protect human workers, making them a lot stronger while keeping their mobility at max. A working bay of car manufacture can lead to many potential hazards to the workers due to the heavy machinery and circuitry network, so such equipment is a huge step forward to a safer working bay. Examples of exoskeleton development are <strong>Hyundai Vest Exoskeleton (H-VEX)</strong> and <strong>Hyundai Vest Exoskeleton (H-CEX)</strong> actively used by Kia Motors at their factories.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Day by day, there is a tremendous amount of automotive increase in every part of the world, for e.g. Asia has 141% more cars than it has a decade ago. As the more crowded the road , more will be the risk factors. Today’s Automotive industries cannot only rely on Quality and driver cautious. Artificial intelligence stack of improved technology for every car is a significant step towards our safety and positive experience for each car users of tomorrow.</p>
