      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;winning-space-race-with-data-science&#34;&gt;Winning Space Race with Data Science&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;space-x-landing-prediction-is-an-applied-data-science-capstone-project-done-as-part-of-ibm-data-science-certificationhttpswwwcourseraorgaccountaccomplishmentsprofessional-certhqzx8fq3kar4-program&#34;&gt;Space-X Landing Prediction is an Applied Data Science Capstone Project done as part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/HQZX8FQ3KAR4&#34;&gt;IBM Data Science Certification&lt;/a&gt; Program.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to provide analysis on SpaceX launches, with focus on stage reuse and landings, to provide our company, SpaceY, competitive information on cost of launches and prediction methods on whether SpaceX will reuse a given stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;methodology&#34;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data collection:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SpaceX API: Past landing data, plus info on boosters, cores, payloads;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia scrape: Parse tables of past launches (including outcomes ‚Äî success/failure) into a DataFrame for next stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data wrangling:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcomes (‚ÄúTrue ASDS‚Äù, ‚ÄúTrue Ocean‚Äù, etc.) grouped into two classes ‚Äî success (1) and failure (0);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Column ‚Äòclass‚Äô added to DataFrame, to be used for model building and prediction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploratory data analysis&lt;/strong&gt; (EDA) using Visualization and SQL:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data loaded into IBM Cloud DB2 instance;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL queries run from Jupyter notebook;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plotly and Seaborn; categorical plots (scatter, bar, line);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-hot encoding of features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactive visual analytics&lt;/strong&gt; using Folium and Plotly Dash:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Folium maps + marker clusters: show launch sites;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dashboard: show successes for all launch sites, success percentage per site, and payload per launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive analysis using classification models:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split data between training and testing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train and test 4 models: LogReg (logistic regression), SVM (support vector machine), Tree (decision tree), KNN (K nearest neighbors);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grid Search with a set of hyperparams; check model scores (R^2); build confusion matrix for each; ‚Äî&amp;gt; select best model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions-predictive-model&#34;&gt;Conclusions (Predictive Model)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of 4 prediction models (LogReg, SVM, Tree, KNN), &lt;strong&gt;SVM&lt;/strong&gt; had the best accuracy on training data, and among the best at scores on test data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tree model appeared the weakest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test vs Training data accuracy are not the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dataset is too small (only 90 observations) to distinguish any further between these models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;experience-analysis-through-weather-data&#34;&gt;Experience Analysis through Weather Data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing accurate weather conditions is an important element for individuals as well as organizations. Many businesses rely on weather conditions. It is necessary to have the correct data to get accurate decisions. One type of data that‚Äôs easier to find on the internet is Weather data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Analysis project was done as a part of my Data Analytics Internship at &lt;a href=&#34;https://suvenconsultants.com/&#34;&gt;Suven Consultants &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main objective is to perform data cleaning, perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming on temperature and humidity, and finally put forth a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hypothesis&#34;&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Null Hypothesis H0 is ‚ÄúHas the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming‚Äù ‚Äî That means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month says April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/functions/emojify/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;emojify&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function can be called directly in templates or &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/#inline-shortcodes&#34;&gt;Inline Shortcodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable emoji globally, set &lt;code&gt;enableEmoji&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; in your site&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/&#34;&gt;configuration&lt;/a&gt; and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experience Analysis through Weather Data : Exploratory Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://sinanthahir.github.io/blogs/exp-weather-eda/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;experience-analysis-through-weather-data--exploratory-data-analysis&#34;&gt;Experience Analysis through Weather Data : Exploratory Data Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;cover.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing accurate weather conditions is an important element for individuals as well as organizations. Many businesses rely on weather conditions. It is necessary to have the correct data to get accurate decisions. One type of data that‚Äôs easier to find on the internet is Weather data. Many sites provide historical data on many meteorological parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyze data, to summarize the main characteristics of data, and better understand the data set. It also allows us to quickly interpret the data and adjust different variables to see their effect. The three main steps to get a perfect EDA are &lt;code&gt;extracting&lt;/code&gt; the data from an authorized source, &lt;code&gt;cleaning&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;processing&lt;/code&gt; the data, and performing data &lt;code&gt;visualization&lt;/code&gt; on the cleaned data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I will work through out a practical exploratory data analysis which was done a part of my data analytics internship at &lt;a href=&#34;https://suvenconsultants.com/&#34;&gt;Suven Consultants &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus of our project was to perform analysis for testing the Influences of Global Warming and finally put forth a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hypothesis&#34;&gt;Hypothesis:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hypothesis is an assumption, an idea that is proposed for the sake of argument so that it can be tested to see if it might be true.






    
    


&lt;div class=&#34;rounded p-3 my-6&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #d9edf7; color: #31708f;&#34; &gt;
    
The Null Hypothesis H0 is ‚ÄúHas the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming‚Äù

&lt;/div&gt;

That means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month says April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, What is this Apparent Temperature and Humidity mentioned in the Null Hypothesis (H0)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are called Terminologies, or rather say the column names or criteria used to constrain the data we have to different specification or class. In order to know that we must look up for basic terminologies used in the data we are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terminologies&#34;&gt;Terminologies:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meteorological Data&lt;/strong&gt; refers to data consisting of physical parameters that are measured directly by instrumentation, and include temperature, dew point, wind direction, wind speed, cloud cover, cloud layer(s), ceiling height, visibility, current weather, and precipitation amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apparent temperature&lt;/strong&gt; is the temperature equivalent perceived by humans, caused by the combined effects of air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The measure is most commonly applied to the perceived outdoor temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humidity&lt;/strong&gt; is the amount of water vapor in the air. If there is a lot of water vapor in the air, the humidity will be high. The higher the humidity, the wetter it feels outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out more weather terminologies from &lt;a href=&#34;https://kestrelmeters.com/pages/weather-glossary&#34;&gt;Kestrelmeter‚Äôs Glossary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dataset&#34;&gt;Dataset:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset currently using, can be obtained from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset&#34;&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;. The dataset has hourly temperature recorded for the last 10 years starting from 2006‚Äì04‚Äì01 00:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016‚Äì09‚Äì09 23:00:00.000 +0200. It corresponds to Finland, a country in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have our Objective, Dataset, and basic understanding of the Terminologies. So let‚Äôs start of journey to analyze the data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-preprocessing&#34;&gt;Data Preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, i‚Äôm using Anaconda Environment with Visual Studio Code. You can also set up such a system which enable a faster git and pipeline integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;importing-required-libraries&#34;&gt;Importing required libraries:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;loading-dataset&#34;&gt;Loading dataset:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load the dataset using &lt;code&gt;read_csv()&lt;/code&gt; function as the dataset is in CSV form and read the first 5 rows from data using &lt;code&gt;head()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data = pd.read_csv(&#39;weatherHistory.csv&#39;)
data.head()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;01.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimensions&lt;/strong&gt; of the dataframe refers to the overall data sample, i.e, the total number of rows and columns in the data. It can be obtained using &lt;code&gt;data.shape&lt;/code&gt; function as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.shape
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total number of rows and columns in the data set is &lt;strong&gt;96453&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out the types and overall summary of the data frame, we use the &lt;code&gt;data.info()&lt;/code&gt; function. It comes in handy when doing exploratory analysis of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.info()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;00.png&#34; alt=&#34;info_output&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;describe()&lt;/code&gt; function to get the descriptive statistical details of the data-frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.describe()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;03.png&#34; alt=&#34;stat&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check the distinct elements in the data frame, we can use the &lt;code&gt;nunique()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.nunique()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;04.png&#34; alt=&#34;nunique&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can check for any missing values using the &lt;code&gt;isnull()&lt;/code&gt; function. since having a large dataset, we can incorporate &lt;code&gt;sum()&lt;/code&gt; function to get the total number of missing value in each columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.isnull().sum()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;05.png&#34; alt=&#34;isnull&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till now, we had got up many details about the dataset we are working on. Lets take it into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observations&#34;&gt;Observations:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ‚Äò&lt;em&gt;Precip Type&lt;/em&gt;‚Äô, there are 517 missing values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚Äò&lt;em&gt;Wind Bearing (degrees)&lt;/em&gt;‚Äô has only integer values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formatted Date&lt;/strong&gt; is in String.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimum values of Humidity, Wind Speed (km/h), Wind Bearing (degrees), Visibility (km) are &lt;strong&gt;Zero&lt;/strong&gt; and they can be &lt;strong&gt;Zero&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Statistical details and Distinct Elements in Dataframe, It is noticed that ‚ÄôLoud Cover‚Äô are &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;null&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can &lt;em&gt;remove the unwanted columns&lt;/em&gt; which don‚Äôt add value to the analysis using the &lt;strong&gt;drop()&lt;/strong&gt; function. We will drop ‚ÄòLoud Cover‚Äô as it has one unique value 0 and it is not useful in analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data = data.drop([‚ÄòLoud Cover‚Äô], axis = 1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;correlation-of-the-columns&#34;&gt;Correlation of the Columns:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation matrices are an essential tool of exploratory data analysis. We can display the pairwise correlation using &lt;code&gt;corr()&lt;/code&gt; function which creates the correlation matrix between all the features in the dataset. &lt;strong&gt;Correlation heatmaps&lt;/strong&gt; contain the same information in a visually appealing way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# assign data correlation matrix
relation = data.corr()

# Increase the size of the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))

# Store heatmap object in a variable to easily access it
when you want to include more features and you can set 
the annotation parameter to True to display the 
correlation values on the heatmap.
sns.heatmap(data=relation)

# Give a title to the heatmap.
plt.title(&amp;quot;Correlation of columns in the dataframe&amp;quot;)

# save the figure.
plt.savefig(&#39;plot1.png&#39;, dpi=300, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;)
plt.show()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;06.png&#34; alt=&#34;heatmap&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation&#34;&gt;Observation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Pairwise correlation chart, we can see that &lt;em&gt;Apparent Temperature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Humidity&lt;/em&gt; have a high degree of correlation with each other. So we have a high chance of validating our hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We only need 3 columns for checking and validating our task which is data &lt;strong&gt;[‚ÄòFormatted Date‚Äô, ‚ÄòApparent Temperature(c)‚Äô, ‚ÄòHumidity‚Äô]&lt;/strong&gt;. So, we can ignore other columns and missing values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parsing-dates-creating-new-dataframe-&#34;&gt;Parsing Dates, Creating new dataframe :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the ‚ÄòFormatted Date‚Äô feature from String to Datetime using the &lt;code&gt;datetime()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data[‚ÄòFormatted Date‚Äô] = pd.to_datetime(data[‚ÄòFormatted Date‚Äô],utc=True)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can set ‚ÄúFormatted Date‚Äù as an index using the &lt;code&gt;set_index()&lt;/code&gt; function which sets the DataFrame index (row labels) using one or more existing columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;data = data.set_index(‚ÄúFormatted Date‚Äù)
data.info()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;07.png&#34; alt=&#34;parsed&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;resampling-data&#34;&gt;Resampling Data:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resampling&lt;/strong&gt; is a convenient method for frequency conversion. The object must have a datetime like an index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have hourly data, we need to resample it to monthly. We only require the Apparent Temperature and humidity columns to test the hypothesis. So, we will consider these two columns and perform a &lt;code&gt;resample()&lt;/code&gt; function from Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;df_column = [&#39;Apparent Temperature (C)&#39;, &#39;Humidity&#39;]
df_monthly_mean = data[df_column].resample(&amp;quot;MS&amp;quot;).mean() 
#MS-Month Starting
df_monthly_mean.head()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we converts hourly data to monthly data using ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;MS&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù which denotes the Month starting. We are displaying the average apparent temperature and humidity using the &lt;strong&gt;mean()&lt;/strong&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;08.png&#34; alt=&#34;resample&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are done with cleaning and resampling it. Now, Lets begin our analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relation-between-apparent-temperature--humidity-using-regression&#34;&gt;Relation between Apparent Temperature &amp;amp; Humidity Using Regression:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the &lt;code&gt;regplot()&lt;/code&gt; function to plot the relationship between the ‚ÄúApparent Temperature ‚Äù and ‚ÄúHumidity‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# calling regplot function and assign it with our data and plot labels and color parameter.
sns.regplot(data=df_monthly_mean, x=&amp;quot;Apparent Temperature (C)&amp;quot;, y=&amp;quot;Humidity&amp;quot;, color=&amp;quot;r&amp;quot;)

# Give a title to the plot
plt.title(&amp;quot;Relation between Apparent Temperature (C) and Humidity&amp;quot;)

# save the figure
plt.savefig(&#39;plot2.png&#39;, dpi=300, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;)
plt.show()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;09.png&#34; alt=&#34;regplot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation-1&#34;&gt;Observation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Linear Relation between ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Apparent Temperature&lt;/em&gt; ‚Äù and ‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Humidity&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù with a &lt;strong&gt;negative&lt;/strong&gt; slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As air temperature increases, air can hold more water molecules, and its relative humidity decreases. When temperatures drop, relative humidity increases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yearly-variation-of-apparent-temperature-and-humidity&#34;&gt;Yearly Variation of Apparent Temperature and Humidity:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;lineplot()&lt;/code&gt; function to plot the Variation of Apparent Temperature and Humidity with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plt.figure(figsize=(15,7))
sns.lineplot(data= df_monthly_mean)
plt.xlabel(&#39;year&#39;)
plt.title(&#39;Variation of Apparent Temprature and HUmidity with Time&#39;)
plt.savefig(&#39;plot3.png&#39;, dpi=300, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;)
plt.show()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;10.png&#34; alt=&#34;var&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above graph displays average temperature and humidity for all 12 months over the 10 years i.e., from 2006 to 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation-2&#34;&gt;Observation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Humidity&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù remained constant from 2006‚Äì2016&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚Äú&lt;em&gt;Apparent Temperature&lt;/em&gt;‚Äù changed from 2006‚Äì2016 at regular intervals with constant amplitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;variation-of-humidity--apparent-temperature-for-all-months&#34;&gt;Variation of Humidity &amp;amp; Apparent Temperature for all months:&lt;/h2&gt;

This function helps to analyze the variations in Apparent Temperature and Humidity for all months over the 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;january&#34;&gt;January&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;13.png&#34; alt=&#34;jan&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;february&#34;&gt;February&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;14.png&#34; alt=&#34;feb&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;15.png&#34; alt=&#34;mar&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;observation-3&#34;&gt;Observation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As from the above plots, we can understand that, ‚ÄôThe Apparent Temperature‚Äô has a tremendous fluctuation over the time period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a sharp rise of temperature between year 2008‚Äì2009 which again decreases in year 2009‚Äì2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is observed that the average Apparent Temperature is at its peak in year 2009 which further drops to its lowest in year 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whereas the average Humidity has remained nearly constant over the period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this analysis, We can conclude that the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming. This clears that our &lt;em&gt;Null Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; is having a &lt;strong&gt;True positive&lt;/strong&gt; impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do more analysis on the data, the more we question the data, the better we know about it. You can create more and more Hypothesis to verify more about your objective. You can also create a weather prediction model; using this data to train and test your model. It‚Äôs all up to you. That is one of the best thing about exploratory data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Better Decision from Bitter Opinions !</title>
      <link>https://sinanthahir.github.io/bookshelf/betterdecision-bitteropinions/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sinanthahir.github.io/bookshelf/betterdecision-bitteropinions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;better-decision-from-bitter-opinions-&#34;&gt;Better Decision from Bitter Opinions !&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why criticism is good for you !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criticism means the expression of disagreement of someone or something that is based on perceived beliefs, faults and mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the point is to consider whether it‚Äôs good or not. Taking criticism can be a difficult thing. Nobody likes to be told that something they have slaved over for days didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark. If we go by it‚Äôs meaning; to criticize someone is bad and even if you know some of your work probably deserved some extra love, criticism always stings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, it may lead to improvement of the person being criticized and he becoming a better person, not repeating the mistakes again. At some point, even my writings ‚Äî &lt;em&gt;are so dependant on reviews and opinions&lt;/em&gt;. Though one day you will encounter a customer or your audience and even a reviewer ‚Äî who wants to tell you how to do things better. But it‚Äôs not all bad news because sometimes you can use criticism to give you a competitive edge. It entirely depends upon the perceived value hidden behind the criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;criticism--a-form-of-communication&#34;&gt;Criticism : a form of communication.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone has a criticism for you; literally take it as they want to give you a feedback on what you are done or doing for them. &lt;strong&gt;We all make mistakes all the time, it is human nature&lt;/strong&gt;. As we go through life we have plenty of opportunity to learn and improve ourselves. That means &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is an opportunity to learn more about the person who you‚Äôre working for and in case your a influencer or in business; how to convert them into a satisfied customer or audience member.&lt;/p&gt;






    
    


&lt;div class=&#34;rounded p-3 my-6&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f2dede; color: #a94442;&#34; &gt;
    
‚ÄúAny fool can criticize, condemn, and complain but it takes character and self control to be understanding and forgiving.‚Äù ‚Äî Dale Carnegie

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, there may be some truth behind each criticism you get; even it is given out on spite and bitterness. The criticism aimed at you may not make sense at the time, It is often the case that a slight change on your character is a fair reflection of how another person sees you at that point in time. So take a step-back, try to look from other‚Äôs perspective or ask the opinions of a honest friend, that will make you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;criticism--gives-you-a-competitive-advantage&#34;&gt;Criticism : gives you a Competitive advantage.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot be sure whatever the critic is saying is right. Having heard him out, compare his statements or assessments with the facts on the ground. Sort out what is true from what is a biased statement and make objective analysis of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it : if you are a Salesperson and can get a customer to tell you ‚Äî and just you ‚Äî how to give them the perfect product or service, that‚Äôs information you‚Äôve got that no one else has. Even being a criticism too, the information you gets, puts you at an advantage over anyone else in your sector and can be used again in the future to get things right, even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are open to suggestions around how you might approach things differently, you‚Äôll be perceived as a more authentic leader and it‚Äôll be easier for you to rally a team around a common goal or towards improving shared processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;think-before-act&#34;&gt;Think Before Act.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt take it personally if someone doesn‚Äôt immediately like your work. Not everyone has pure motives when it comes to giving you feedback. If the criticism you‚Äôre receiving really stings, think about what that person is saying. &lt;em&gt;Are they talking about something that directly influences the way you work or your behavior in a specific situation? Or are they more concerned about you come off as a person?&lt;/em&gt; The key thing to remember is that whatever the circumstance is, don¬¥t respond in anger as this will cause a scene and create bad feelings ‚Äî and possibly a bad image of you.&lt;/p&gt;






    
    


&lt;div class=&#34;rounded p-3 my-6&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #f2dede; color: #a94442;&#34; &gt;
    
Remember: when people tell you something‚Äôs wrong or doesn‚Äôt work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong. ‚Äî Neil Gaiman.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be occasions when you feel the criticism is personal and, now and then, you‚Äôll be right.If feedback is based on something intrinsic to your personality, it‚Äôs not important enough to worry about. Criticism needs to be partnered with a solution to help you correct the action. If it‚Äôs not, the person is not interested in helping enough to warrant getting involved, literally it‚Äôs enough for them to shut up.They are also able to make it work to their advantage or, if all else fails, politely conclude the partnership and leave with their reputation intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsure of how effectively you‚Äôre communicating? Try to transform your critical phrases into feedback that inspires change. May these words help you along !&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is it okay to show your flaws ?</title>
      <link>https://sinanthahir.github.io/bookshelf/fallinlovewithflaws/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sinanthahir.github.io/bookshelf/fallinlovewithflaws/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-it-okay-to-show-your-flaws&#34;&gt;Is it okay to show your flaws?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-and-how-i-fall-in-love-with-my-flaws-&#34;&gt;When and how, i Fall in Love with My Flaws !&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of us are taught to hide our flaws. the fact is that each one of us from the childhood to the very existence of life; try to preserve our flaws and insecurities. but not a single one of us is perfect. And that‚Äôs one of the great thing of the life. Not only we do have flaws, but each of us struggles with feeling flawed at some situations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a student-entrepreneur, i too had many time flawed. All the adrenaline shot up in the head, at the time of brain-storming sections. As a core member, the idea‚Äôs or for the suggestion‚Äôs ‚Äî i need them intact or rather say; to be good. But for me, &lt;em&gt;how to convey properly&lt;/em&gt; , or &lt;em&gt;how to make others understand&lt;/em&gt; , all of a sudden such thoughts came to hit me, when standing in front of them. One of the colleague said, it was overthinking, that make me do so, but really need to appreciate her for hearing me out, cause overthinking is one of my flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes ! Even now when i‚Äôm writing it, i‚Äôm indeed flawed! i don‚Äôt know how much my idea is going to lay impact on you. Now, you may be thinking me, being a dumb ass over-thinker; Haha, though some time these flaws really in-&lt;strong&gt;turns out to be good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly at many times, these over-thoughts turned my strategic action very beneficial. That was the moment, made me to fall in love with my flaws. May be some of you had already accepted there flaws or some are still cliche to there flaws. To say, there will some times, when you really love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-wabi-sabi&#34;&gt;Lets talk about Wabi-Sabi.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my analogy hadn‚Äôt able to ‚Äòhit a hole‚Äô for you, lets try a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japanese culture, there is an art form known as wabi-sabi. It has been around for centuries. When a plate becomes chipped or cracked, it is not discarded like trash. The cracks are filled with metallic materials to accentuate their details. Wabi-sabi celebrates imperfections because no two are exactly the same. You possess that uniqueness in your own life, and you should be proud of what it‚Äôs helped you become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we all know how difficult it is to accept flaws. It‚Äôs a difficult thing to do when it comes to other people and when it comes to ourselves, well, it‚Äôs can seem nearly impossible. But, hard as it might seem, it is possible to love even the most flaws and it‚Äôs much essential to live a positive present life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But to live so, First learn to love yourself for who you are!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving yourself means loving even the not-so-great parts of yourself. Learning to love your flaws is going to be a constant battle, but that is a worth a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-lets-get-to-know-how-to-fall-in-love-with-your-flaw&#34;&gt;So lets get to know how to fall in love with your Flaw.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-look-for-something-you-can-do-about-it&#34;&gt;1. Look For Something you can do about it.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foremost, you need to check whether if the flaws troubling is something you can actually do something for it, in case of flaws like ‚Äî bad temper or wicked impatience should not be accepted instead should work on. It‚Äôs not like throwing up your hands and saying, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the way I am!‚Äù. Ask Yourself : Does the flaw negatively impact you and others? Is there anything I can do to change it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-determine-your-actually-going-to-do-something&#34;&gt;2. Determine your actually going to do something.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only you know and you only will know, deep down whether the flaw bugs you or not, now it‚Äôs time to be brutally honest with yourself. If you‚Äôve determined that a flaw is to be changed. You can change it, but will you ? If you know it needs to be changed and you‚Äôre going to put in the effort, awesome! Go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-view-it-in-others-perspective&#34;&gt;3. View it in other‚Äôs Perspective.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre so close to our flaws that they seem so much larger to us, i.e magnified by our own perception. The things you see as horrible or offensive might not look so bad when you try seeing them from an outsider‚Äôs point of view. In your mind, take a step back and try to imagine from other‚Äôs perspective about the flaw. When it comes, consider and contemplate how you would react to it when it is spotted on someone else. There you gets the clear image of your flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-accept-for-really-what-it-is&#34;&gt;4. Accept for really what it is.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, accept your flaw for exactly what it is. After viewing from other person view and understanding about the flaw, now it‚Äôs time to take one step further ‚Äî simply accept it for what it is. Don‚Äôt compare it to others or rate it on a scale of good/bad. Strip it from all internal judgments; Accept it for what it is and realize that it &lt;strong&gt;is a part of you&lt;/strong&gt;. Your flaws make you who you are, &lt;strong&gt;so embrace them&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should be on the road to either changing or loving your flaws, these steps allowed me to accept my flaws. Only you will know which flaw you should be working on and which one you need to accept and love. Remember Everyone has something, may be many he or she is flawed. But only Some people proactively choose to accept and love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be one among them. &lt;strong&gt;Love Your Flaws !&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://sinanthahir.medium.com/is-it-okay-to-show-your-flaws-e88980107fde&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; dated Sep 25, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-project-aria-going-to-change-everyday-life--facebooks-wearable-ar&#34;&gt;How Project Aria going to change everyday life : Facebook‚Äôs Wearable AR&lt;/h2&gt;






    
    


&lt;div class=&#34;rounded p-3 my-6&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #d9edf7; color: #31708f;&#34; &gt;
    
‚Äú Augmented Reality ‚Äî Enhancing flow of everyday life ‚Äù

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook‚Äôs Full AR glasses are much away from reaching to our hands, but had started there road-test mapping with Cluster of sensors or to particularly say a ‚ÄòSensory array‚Äô debut research device in Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area. A group of 100 Facebook employees and others getting hands on these, testing and for the thrive for data collection. The company announced the news Wednesday at its virtual &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebookconnect.com/en&#34;&gt;Facebook Connect&lt;/a&gt; conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-is-this-project-aria-&#34;&gt;So what is this PROJECT ARIA ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Project Aria, Facebook‚Äôs Reality Labs is trying to vision a future device free flow into the everyday life expect for the pair of glasses. these are not just the ordinary glasses, but a Augmented Reality Wearable. As Facebook says these pair of glasses adds a 3D layer of useful, relevant and meaningful information on top of our physical world. they projects out examples like- ‚ÄúImagine calling a friend and chatting with their lifelike avatar across the table. Imagine a digital assistant smart enough to detect road hazards, offer up stats during a business meeting, or even help you hear better in a noisy environment‚Äù. It paves the way for doing the everyday task at a better way and opens up an entirely new way of moving through the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/&#34;&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; an advanced stand-alone VR headset, is one of the Facebook‚Äôs Current Immersive Product on the market. But there AR ambition are going much a further way; The company is looking forward in creating a spatial scan of the real word called &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/projectaria/&#34;&gt;Live Map&lt;/a&gt; which will in-turn creates a better relation with people and other objects, giving a sense to the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Facebook‚Äôs Reality Lab envisions to provide a better connectivity with no look downs to your devices. They are looking to a world where the device itself disappears in to the flow of life. Thus Project Aria is a new research project that will help us build the first generation of wearable AR devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tdj9U0pyem4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook says ‚ÄúTo actually build glasses flexible enough to work for most face shapes and sizes, and create the software to support them, we still need &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebooks-chief-scientist-mass-adoption-of-ar-is-years-away&#34;&gt;several generations of breakthroughs&lt;/a&gt;, like systems to enhance audio and visual input, contextualized AI, and a lightweight frame to house it all‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-visionary-research-tool-&#34;&gt;A visionary research tool !&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook puts into light that ‚ÄòThe Project Aria glasses are not a consumer product, nor are they a prototype‚Äô but a step into the future step in AR efforts. They are looking forward for a research device that will help us understand how to build the software and hardware necessary for AR glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zue1pxGJnvg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Aria glasses use sensors to capture video and audio from the wearer‚Äôs point of view, as well as eye movement and location data to help our engineers and programmers figure out how AR glasses can work in practice.but that information will be held on-device and not be seen by Facebook researchers before blurring the data of faces and sensitive information like car license plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook plans to train an AI Assistant adapted for the glasses usage through the smart spatial audio technology. they also plans in refining the Livemaps; which will provide a 3D array of data and be a backbone for navigation through these glasses.They are practically improving the concept of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ai.facebook.com/blog/new-milestones-in-embodied-ai/&#34;&gt;embodied AI&lt;/a&gt; through these glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first test run is set offed, Project Aria glasses are initially be made available to a limited group of Facebook employees and contractors in the United States, trained in both where and when to use the device, and where and when not to. Project Aria is most definitely not an actual pair of smartglasses. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúsensor array‚Äù for those future glasses. Facebook‚Äôs post on Aria says it will have ‚Äúthe full sensor suite used in VR headsets for spatial awareness,‚Äù adding, ‚Äúthey also compute location from GPS, take high-res pictures, and capture multichannel audio and eye images‚Äù. But the intersection of the real world and the data-collecting challenges smartglasses pose sounds like an extremely tricky problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;privacy-matters-&#34;&gt;Privacy Matters !&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is promising to take care with data on the glasses. The testers are reportedly being instructed on how to use these devices responsibly. But the glasses will be tested lots of public spaces. In privately owned public places they‚Äôre supposed to get consent before recording. The data being recorded is encrypted and then Facebook uses a ‚Äúsecure ingestion system to upload data from the devices to a separate, designated storage space, accessible only to researchers with approved access.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public-collected data will ‚Äúnot be used to inform the ads people see across Facebook‚Äôs apps,‚Äù Facebook‚Äôs Project Aria privacy guidelines say. But that also suggests that, eventually, information on AR headsets could be used to target ads. It would be dealt with in the near AR future amidst not now. You can view the &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.fb.com/realitylabs/projectaria/privacy-policy/&#34;&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; guidelines by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;Challenges!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook say‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe biggest initial challenge they are facing is to finding a way to take all of the existing sensors necessary to make AR work, and fitting them on a pair of glasses that participants could actually wear.‚Äù not only the design specification but also a more number of problem to be solved like Heat dissipated from micro-computers used, better wireless connectivity provision, light weight frames, better battery life to run all day long, a framework for storing and indexing your virtual objects( virtual co-ordinates ) placed by the user to another user‚Äôs view, preparing a well developed navigation which see‚Äôs better and understand the surroundings ; as a wearable, the contrast ratio correction as moving from sun to dark workplaces, varying focal lengths suitable for various peoples, better field view even with the 3D layer infographics . As Bosworth says ‚ÄúThis is a playground of challenging problems‚Äù , yes purely a many number solution is yet need to be founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;looking-forward&#34;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook in one hand is really looking for providing an evolutionary research in AR ‚Äî making a better flow in the everyday life. Though the privacy matters are really a complicated weird line, if it is from Facebook. However the Facebook‚Äôs view ‚Äúfor a world with fewer devices and more time spent enjoying moments with family and friends, where opportunity is defined by passions, not geography or circumstance‚Äù sounds like a better tomorrow .&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-and-ml--shaping-the-new-automotive-era&#34;&gt;AI and ML : Shaping the New Automotive Era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúArtificial intelligence living in every vehicle will become our reality before you know it.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;






    
    


&lt;div class=&#34;rounded p-3 my-6&#34; style=&#34;background-color: #d9edf7; color: #31708f;&#34; &gt;
    
Frank Borman once said ‚ÄúExploration is really the essence of the human spirit.‚Äù

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there lies no mistake at all, we are exploring only at a very starting verge of AI and ML ‚Äòs potentials in the new era of industries. Many of the technologies like Data Science, Text Mining, Neural Networking and Machine Learning are partially embedded in e-commerce, financial and online social platforms. Soon it will show its much dominance in manufacturing and automotive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day by day the technology evolves, so does the automotive with its trends and discoveries. We can‚Äôt barely imagine a day without riding our own vehicle or hopping on some kind of public transport. From the recent AI developments proved that artificial intelligence will soon transform every device we‚Äôre using. That means even your vehicle too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people thoughts that AI application in Automotive means the creation of auto-driving cars, still more advancement can be taken up for a better user end product. So, let‚Äôs take a dive into what are the ways &lt;strong&gt;AI application evolves the automotive industry&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;driver-assist&#34;&gt;Driver Assist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI-based driver assistants bring massive changes to the navigation and safety measures on the road. It is an easy aid for those in-experienced and diverted in middle of driving, but also enhances the communication between the car and its owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a plenty of real-time monitoring sensors, these AI assist can check blind zones, measure the exact distance to objects, and prevent emergencies from happening thereby saving lives on the road. These Assist software, in-fact can alert the driver behavior through monitoring drivers sitting posture, eye closings and much more. The best part of such driver assist AI application functionality is that, it can be customized according to the driver‚Äôs needs ‚Äî Ambulances, fire engines, public transports and school buses each have its own peculiarities and AI can do all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;autopilot-driving&#34;&gt;Autopilot Driving&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since some-what time, people actually rely on the driver assistance‚Äî entrusting their safety and well-being. The idea of self-driving cars isn‚Äôt new, it‚Äôs the rapid development in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence made it possible. Although the fact of car driving its own and the actual driver becoming the passenger is shocking and feared by many. But thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tesla.com/autopilot&#34;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://waymo.com/tech/&#34;&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt; turns this fiction into an absolute inevitable reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs all about the big data AI should process while driving much what to be like an experienced driver; pressing the pedals and following the GPS tips is simply not enough. Hopefully the higher competition in this area and innovative developments in both AI and Automotive industries will really bring us some high-performing solutions in the nearest future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-and-connective&#34;&gt;Cloud and Connective&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best application of cloud integration in the automotive industry is the car connectivity through an internet access/ Wlan on board. With these applications, the cars can connect to a network and even with other cars; transmitting the generated data to the cloud and accessing it, increases a lot benefits to all road users such as certain condition in each location, data to manufactures about vehicle evaluation and maintenance and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;planned-maintenance&#34;&gt;Planned Maintenance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the gas indicators to the distance compiler, checking on every monitors and sensors; your car basically knows what is about to happen with AI running. Thus, Car Cloud Connectivity takes Maintenance to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI assistant with cloud integration; not only gathers the real-time data, but also stores every single record of data for future analytics and statistics. AI can analyse for Car performance and predict component failures, so vehicle manufacturers and owners can work proactively to avoid problems. Since it connects the manufacture to the consumer end increasing a more problem-solving environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seamless Cloud experience is now under construction named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/02/volkswagen-and-microsoft-share-progress-on-strategic-partnership.html&#34;&gt;Volkswagen Cloud Experience&lt;/a&gt; by Microsoft and Volkswagen which intended in saving natural resources and increasing road safety while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;individualized-marketing&#34;&gt;Individualized marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about it is that AI in your car software doesn‚Äôt complicate the user experience whatsoever It can also provide drivers with location‚Äëbased information and personalized advertising to help them find the things they need. This puts companies into a position when they have to look for marketing channels that would not overwhelm their potential customers, and connected AI automotive assistants come in hand here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud platform with AI driven is in close with driver and able to analyze consumer preference, action on roads and stops. This help the big companies with data, that can really able to make predictive marketing campaigns and advertisements for capturing the target audience basing on the location and personal preferences. A driver can get instant notifications about sales or some good deals on his way while driving. The same goes with a low fuel level or a need to visit the service, the AI assistant will notify about the gas station and car service on the driver‚Äôs route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-assessment&#34;&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having access to driver‚Äôs recent life events, analyzing his actions in road and more can in turn make Artificial Intelligence to find out any typical future threats to the driver. Suck risk profiles are much accurate since AI take into account of low lifestyle factors too. So with the Combination of Insurance Industry with the Connected Car Cloud, the possibility of better service can be retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ai-and-ml-in-manufacturing&#34;&gt;AI and ML in Manufacturing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data generated by the many sensors now embedded in vehicles, extracted from the design and development phase through to testing and production to marketing and compiled from customer feedback are powerful sources of information. Their analysis and interpretation provide equally powerful levers for improvement in design, testing and maintenance; as well as for understanding user needs and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robotics in manufacturing isn‚Äôt new to anyone these days, however, the AI applications at car manufacturing are not that spread yet. Market leaders are currently occupied with these AI applied Robotics in manufacturing plants since the potential cost of implementation is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly in the warehouse management, the most high-end car manufacturers also use robots to collect, move, and sort items shortening the manual labor, as well as take part in vehicle assembly building.Some robots can also detect inaccuracies and defects on the car surface The technology behind smart robots is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping&#34;&gt;Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî a computational method of constructing a map of an unknown environment and navigation in it. Some preset algorithm in robots are used in order in manufacturing wielding , exterior painting and so on, which drastically reduce manual labors and up-cycling time and rate of manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these preset and movable robots, research are lead by many top-end manufacturing company look out for exoskeleton wearable industrial robots to protect human workers, making them a lot stronger while keeping their mobility at max. A working bay of car manufacture can lead to many potential hazards to the workers due to the heavy machinery and circuitry network, so such equipment is a huge step forward to a safer working bay. Examples of exoskeleton development are &lt;strong&gt;Hyundai Vest Exoskeleton (H-VEX)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hyundai Vest Exoskeleton (H-CEX)&lt;/strong&gt; actively used by Kia Motors at their factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day by day, there is a tremendous amount of automotive increase in every part of the world, for e.g. Asia has 141% more cars than it has a decade ago. As the more crowded the road , more will be the risk factors. Today‚Äôs Automotive industries cannot only rely on Quality and driver cautious. Artificial intelligence stack of improved technology for every car is a significant step towards our safety and positive experience for each car users of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Write a book: Atleast one in your lifetime.</title>
      <link>https://sinanthahir.github.io/bookshelf/writebook/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://sinanthahir.github.io/bookshelf/writebook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-a-book-at-least-one-in-your-lifetime&#34;&gt;Write a book: At least one in your lifetime.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youll-discover-who-you-are-unless-youve-tried-it&#34;&gt;You‚Äôll discover who you are; unless you‚Äôve tried it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in this world with 7.8 Billion others, you hear that number; each individual with there own life story and putting each one‚Äôs creativeness forward to paper in your solace; can actually be a relief and thus a new writer is born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a book considered as a skill but for me it‚Äôs upskilling. Listen, everyone can be a writer. Each one of us have a story to share. In fact, more stories to put forward. But the truth to write these stories, first &lt;strong&gt;you need to start write&lt;/strong&gt;. Here come the prior stepping stones‚Äì &lt;strong&gt;Dedication and Passion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By its very nature, Writing is an introspective and thoughtful activity. You don‚Äôt have to complete a book in a month or two; take your time. The more time you take in writing, the more you experience. If you‚Äôre an amateur, starting to write ‚Äî go for &lt;strong&gt;your trajectory of life&lt;/strong&gt;. Many people think they need to do something massive or be famous to write about their life, That‚Äôs not truth at all. The reason behind writing about your life is that you have a real story; something worth changing lives of others with your trial and tribulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even you aren‚Äôt ready for a memoir, thou still have a valuable piece of short influential timeline, experiences or the knowledge gained that can help others; can be pen downed. It‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;hard to peek inside&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the hardest things in our life is to look inside ourselves. The harder you self-reflect, the more you discover who you been these all time. It can be objected a time when &lt;strong&gt;we evaluate ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;not-to-mention-writing-a-memoir&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not to mention writing a memoir.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to write a book about yourself is to get really, really &lt;strong&gt;honest&lt;/strong&gt; and dig into the raw and deep parts about yourself. Nobody wants a book about you that‚Äôs all sunshine and rainbows because that‚Äôs not real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;if-youre-writing-about-yourself-here-are-some-tips&#34;&gt;If You‚Äôre writing about yourself, here are some tips.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide what you need to write about yourself or a part of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-reflect your own life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify the experiences you want to share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a mind-map of experience to connect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take those ideas and starts to write an outline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through writing, you‚Äôll &lt;em&gt;gain perspective&lt;/em&gt; towards what really matters you. It will also teach you, &lt;strong&gt;the unique value of your own willpower&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a book is a way to touch your thoughts, values, and motivations. This simple act of writing can perish to measure the depths of your discipline and efforts. Because, writing is cheaper than a therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that counts is that you get your first word on paper, and then a word after that. You owe it to yourself to explore your passion and write a book. When you‚Äôre writing about something you love, it won‚Äôt feel like work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the hectic, tasks of drafting and publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shady statistic, only 1% of world population ever publishes a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what you write a book about, whether you published it or not; that you write will open the door to your inwards or for more ideas. You‚Äôll educate yourself on a broad array of ideas to tackle more obstacles, Life thrown at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a book is leaving your comfort zone. &lt;strong&gt;The only way you grow as a person is by forcing yourself to leave your comfort zone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to touch the sky‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää&lt;strong&gt;write a book yourselves. Discover who you really are&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
