<h4 id="when-and-how-i-fall-in-love-with-my-flaws-">When and how, i Fall in Love with My Flaws !</h4>
<p><em>Most of us are taught to hide our flaws. the fact is that each one of us from the childhood to the very existence of life; try to preserve our flaws and insecurities. but not a single one of us is perfect. And that’s one of the great thing of the life. Not only we do have flaws, but each of us struggles with feeling flawed at some situations.</em></p>
<p>Being a student-entrepreneur, i too had many time flawed. All the adrenaline shot up in the head, at the time of brain-storming sections. As a core member, the idea’s or for the suggestion’s — i need them intact or rather say; to be good. But for me, <em>how to convey properly</em> , or <em>how to make others understand</em> , all of a sudden such thoughts came to hit me, when standing in front of them. One of the colleague said, it was overthinking, that make me do so, but really need to appreciate her for hearing me out, cause overthinking is one of my flaws.</p>
<p>Yes ! Even now when i’m writing it, i’m indeed flawed! i don’t know how much my idea is going to lay impact on you. Now, you may be thinking me, being a dumb ass over-thinker; Haha, though some time these flaws really in-<strong>turns out to be good</strong>.</p>
<p>Frankly at many times, these over-thoughts turned my strategic action very beneficial. That was the moment, made me to fall in love with my flaws. May be some of you had already accepted there flaws or some are still cliche to there flaws. To say, there will some times, when you really love it.</p>
<h3 id="lets-talk-about-wabi-sabi">Lets talk about Wabi-Sabi.</h3>
<p>If my analogy hadn’t able to ‘hit a hole’ for you, lets try a different approach.</p>
<p>In Japanese culture, there is an art form known as wabi-sabi. It has been around for centuries. When a plate becomes chipped or cracked, it is not discarded like trash. The cracks are filled with metallic materials to accentuate their details. Wabi-sabi celebrates imperfections because no two are exactly the same. You possess that uniqueness in your own life, and you should be proud of what it’s helped you become.</p>
<p>Of course we all know how difficult it is to accept flaws. It’s a difficult thing to do when it comes to other people and when it comes to ourselves, well, it’s can seem nearly impossible. But, hard as it might seem, it is possible to love even the most flaws and it’s much essential to live a positive present life.</p>
<p><strong>But to live so, First learn to love yourself for who you are!</strong></p>
<p>Loving yourself means loving even the not-so-great parts of yourself. Learning to love your flaws is going to be a constant battle, but that is a worth a fight.</p>
<h3 id="so-lets-get-to-know-how-to-fall-in-love-with-your-flaw">So lets get to know how to fall in love with your Flaw.</h3>
<h4 id="1-look-for-something-you-can-do-about-it">1. Look For Something you can do about it.</h4>
<p>Foremost, you need to check whether if the flaws troubling is something you can actually do something for it, in case of flaws like — bad temper or wicked impatience should not be accepted instead should work on. It’s not like throwing up your hands and saying, “Oh, that’s the way I am!”. Ask Yourself : Does the flaw negatively impact you and others? Is there anything I can do to change it?</p>
<h4 id="2-determine-your-actually-going-to-do-something">2. Determine your actually going to do something.</h4>
<p>Only you know and you only will know, deep down whether the flaw bugs you or not, now it’s time to be brutally honest with yourself. If you’ve determined that a flaw is to be changed. You can change it, but will you ? If you know it needs to be changed and you’re going to put in the effort, awesome! Go for it!</p>
<h4 id="3-view-it-in-others-perspective">3. View it in other’s Perspective.</h4>
<p>We’re so close to our flaws that they seem so much larger to us, i.e magnified by our own perception. The things you see as horrible or offensive might not look so bad when you try seeing them from an outsider’s point of view. In your mind, take a step back and try to imagine from other’s perspective about the flaw. When it comes, consider and contemplate how you would react to it when it is spotted on someone else. There you gets the clear image of your flaw.</p>
<h4 id="4-accept-for-really-what-it-is">4. Accept for really what it is.</h4>
<p>Last but not least, accept your flaw for exactly what it is. After viewing from other person view and understanding about the flaw, now it’s time to take one step further — simply accept it for what it is. Don’t compare it to others or rate it on a scale of good/bad. Strip it from all internal judgments; Accept it for what it is and realize that it <strong>is a part of you</strong>. Your flaws make you who you are, <strong>so embrace them</strong>!</p>
<p>Now you should be on the road to either changing or loving your flaws, these steps allowed me to accept my flaws. Only you will know which flaw you should be working on and which one you need to accept and love. Remember Everyone has something, may be many he or she is flawed. But only Some people proactively choose to accept and love them.</p>
<p>Be one among them. <strong>Love Your Flaws !</strong></p>
